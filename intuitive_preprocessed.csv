the patient be felt to be at risk secondary to his sick sinus syndrome and new leave bundle-branch block . he be felt to be at risk for asystole and symptomatic bradycardia with any block agent . therefore , transvenous pacer be schedule to be place in the cath lab . hospital course by system : 1. cardiovascular : a. rhythm : shortly after admission , the patient have a temporary ventricular pacer place on 9/13/05 with a heart rate of less than 50. after the procedure , the patient be admit to the ccu with atrial flutter with rvr and a rate in the 20 . the rate be intermittently control with a combination of iv digoxin and lopressor . on 6/6/05 , a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker be implant with vvi at 50. throughout the next two day , the patient 's heart rate continue to be difficult to control , but improve with diltiazem . the patient be initiate on an amiodarone load on 8/22/05 . the following day , he convert to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously . at that time , he continue to be ventricularly pace , and the pacemaker be change to ddd on 10/21/05 . for the remainder of the hospitalization , the patient remain in normal sinus rhythm and be dual-paced without any

question of a vegetation raise concern for possible endocarditis and blood culture be send . the patient 's temperature have be low on admission , since there be some concern that he could be develop sepsis , however nothing grow from the blood culture throughout the remainder of his hospitalization . he be see by cardiology , who do not think that this echo result require further intervention and suspect that it represent a flail tricuspid valve leaflet . the patient 's troponin one troponin level be elevate at 0.11 initially and then another troponin be elevate on 10/27/05 in the setting arf and acute hepatitis . he recently have a negative stress echo at the laketon medical center , so no additional stress testing be pursue during this admission . he be switch to lopressor 25 t.i.d . and then switch back to toprol xl . his statin be discontinue during the admission because of lft abnormality which will be discuss below . he be monitor on telemetry which demonstrate frequent pvc and some nsvt . this should be readdressed in cardiology clinic . cardiology decide to hold off on place an aicd and be to see him a an outpt . 2. gi/renal : on the morning of 10/27/05 , the patient develop new confusion and delirium . he also develop an oxygen requirement the night before . his lab on morning be notable for a transaminitis in the thousand , acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidemia with bicarbonate of 13 , and a new leukocytosis ( wbc 9 to 25 ) . he be start on broad spectrum antibiotic include coverage for bartonella a he have many cat . he be empirically start on mucomyst and acyclovir a per gi in case his lft abnormality be due to tylenol toxicity or hsv . he be initially go to get a liver biopsy but this be cancel a his lfts start to normalize . he have a ruq with doppler which be negative . the etiology of his hepatitis , renal failure and leukocytosis be never identify throughout the admission . cardiology do not think that any of this could be explain by endocarditis and his antibiotic be stop once his culture be negative for multiple day . gi though he could of have shock liver but he be on telemetry the entire time . his tylenol level be normal and his hep seriologies be negative . his lab have all normalize by admission except for his lfts which be still trend downward . 3. infectious disease : due to low temperature and question of vegetation , there be consideration for endocarditis and sepsis although that never pan out . he have a history of feed stray cat and so bartonella culture be send . they take a long time to come back and should be follow up a outpatient . he have be place on antibiotic while await culture but those be discontinue on the 8/18/05 a the microbiology data remain negative . he have a ct scan of his chest and abdomen which do not reveal any infectious source . he have ground glass opacity on his ct chest which be felt to be due to chf when review with the radiologist . he remain afebrile during the admission . 4. psych : early on during the patient 's admission , he do have several episode of tachypnea at rest . they be not positional in nature and resolve with verbal consolation and redirection and deep breath . no associated desaturation at that time . the patient have a history of anxiety and report that that prompt him to increase his lasix dose at home . he refuse psychiatric consultation or social work involvement . his valium have initially be initiate but it be hold in the setting of abnormal lfts . he have no further anxiety attack after that . it be likely that he have mild baseline dementia . his delirium resolve after the acute renal failure and transaminitis resolve . 5. musculoskeletal : the patient have a little bit of difficulty ambulate and be see by physical therapy who do think that further physical therapy would be appropriate . the patient refuse to go to rehabilitation facility , so he be plan to go home with service include physical therapy at home . 6. hematology : the patient be set to go home and then it be note that his platelet have take a slow and steady decline throughout his hospitalization while he be on heparin/lovenox . there be concern that this could represent heparin induce thrombocytopenia and so all heparin product be stop . he be place lepirudin which be choose instead of argatroban because argatroban be clear by liver in light of his hepatitis . his initial pf4 be read a bordeline positive , but the laber later change the result to negative . base on this discrepancy another pf4 be send which be borderline positive . a per the hematology consult , they felt that despite the borderline positive pf4 he do not need prophylactic anticoagulation and that he should refrain from heparin product in the future until a repeat pf4 in check in a few month . discharge medication : aspirin 325 mg daily , lasix 40 mg daily , toprol xl 25 mg daily , accupril 5 mg daily , omeprazole 20 mg daily . diet : low sodium . activity : a tolerate with supervision and advise by the physical therapist . followup appointment : dr. dougall be the patient 's new pcp at the gham mill ridown medical center clinic at the atl hospital , he have an appointment for 3/23/05 at 9:45 a.m. and an appointment with dr. alquisira be make from cardiology 10/21/05 at 2:45 p.m. additional instruction : do not take valium or lipitor

to be 25 % , rather with global hypokinesis . operation or procedure : there be no operation or procedure perform during this admission . hospital course by problem : cardiovascular - the patient be determine initially to be likely in congestive heart failure , with elevated neck vein , and increase leg edema and a low blood pressure . because the patient be determine to be in chf , he be diuresed with iv lasix , and later with p.o . lasix , the patient be diuresed approximately 2 liter per day over a 4-5 period . the patient's blood pressure subsequently rise . after consultation with cardiology , it be determine that a beta blocker and an ace inhibitor should be add to the patient 's medication regimen a his blood pressure would allow , for demonstrated benefit and congestive heart failure . because the patient be initially determine to have some risk of myocardial infarction , have report chest pain the day prior to admission , and have slightly elevate troponins . the patient's troponin and ck-mb be follow until they begin decrease . it be likely that these very small elevation be due to small amount of ischemia from demand , due to the patient 's fluid overload and anemia . the patient be continue on his statin medication . the patient on admission have frequent pvc , and some short run of ventricular tachycardia last less than 5 beat . after diuresis , the patient have no further run of vt , and have only minimal ectopy . the patient 's electrolyte include potassium and magnesium be check daily and replete a necessary . aspirin be withhold from the patient for now , despite have a benefit in cardiac disease of this kind . this be because the patient 's hematocrit be low and he have recently have bleed likely from his bladder . urology department be consult regard this decision . renal/genitourinary : the patient have a long known history of bph and be follow closely at cotson tionlo hospital by dr. josue grefe . the patient be recently admit for these problem due to obstruction , and instrumentation . on admission , the patient 's urine do not have any red blood cell , and he have no obvious clot at any point . after consultation with urology , and after the patient have be diuresing well with lasix , the patient 's foley catheter be remove and after this point he have no problem with urinating . the patient be maintain on proscar in addition to flomax . heme : the patient 's hematocrit drop be likely due to two factor . first of all , the patient be know to have be lose blood in the form of clot from his bladder . this be likely due to bleed from the surface of his prostate where a recent cystoscopy have demonstrate tortuous vein . in addition , the reading of hematocrit of 24.5 on admission be likely secondary to dilution , the patient be massively fluid overload . the patient 's hematocrit rise after diuresis , and be maintain in the 31-32 range without transfusion during admission . he be , however , type and screen , and the plan be to transfuse him should his hematocrit decrease below 30 , give his cardiac history . oncologic : the patient be follow closely by dr. zecchini at hool norhunt general hospital . his most recent treatment be on 8/4/05 and his multiple myeloma seem to be respond well to therapy . during this admission , multiple myeloma be not an active issue . see reb memorial

give haldol intravenously , in addition to ativan , after be give these medication , the patient sleep very well through the night . when he awake the next morning , his mood be much improve , and he apologize for his behavior , report he do not know what happen . because of the change in mental status , several study be obtain to investigate this , a head ct show no acute disease , only some bony change likely chronic due to multiple myeloma . in addition , the patient 's electrolyte be check which be normal , the patient 's fingerstick blood glucose be check which be normal . in addition , an

increase pain . the pain be so severe that it prevent the patient from her daily activity and from walk . the patient present to the emergency department on 4/8 for worsening of her low extremity pain and decrease p.o . intake . on the day of admission the patient state that her diarrhea have resolve and that she have have no abdominal pain . she have have no chest pain or shortness of breath or any other localizing sign of infection except her left leg . on admission she be find to have a temperature of 100 degree fahrenheit and she be place in the short stay unit . subsequently her admission lab be note to reveal elevated lfts and an elevated bun and creatinine with a white blood cell count of 35 , 000. because of these abnormality and renal failure , the patient be transfer out

change . there be multiple venous plaque on the pretibial area of both leg with one venous plaque be ulcerate on the right pretib area . examination of her left thigh reveal a patch of erythema and warmth that be very tender to the touch . neurologic exam be alert and orient time three , intact cranial nerve iii-xii . there be slight decrease in sensation in the patient 's low extremity , leave great than right to pin sensation . her motor exam be otherwise unremarkable . her rectal exam be report to be guaiac negative per the emergency department . laboratory on admission : sodium 133 , potassium 5.2 , bun 43 , and creatinine of 3.7. the patient 's last creatinine value on record be in september of 1996 which be 0.6. her lfts reveal an alt of 71 , ast of 57 , ldh 717 , alkaline phosphatase 196 , total bilirubin 1.1 , direct bilirubin 0.6. her amylase be 8. her albumin be 2.1 and her calcium be 8.2. her cbc on admission reveal a white cell count of 34 , 000 , hematocrit of 29 , and platelet of 624 , 000. the differential on the white blood cell count be 78 polys , 38 band , 6 lymph , 3 monocyte , and no eos . her mcv on her hematocrit be 77. her pt and ptt be both within normal limit . her urinalysis reveal 3+ protein , 1+ leukocyte esterase , 8-12 white blood cell , 20-25 red blood cell , and 2+ squamous epithelial cell . chest x-ray on admission reveal low lung volume with possible left total effusion that be blur leave low lobe air space disease . abdominal ultrasound perform on admission reveal no hydronephrosis , a normal liver biliary system . study be limited secondary to body habitus . low extremity non-invasive study reveal no evidence of deep venous thrombosis . however , exam be limited secondary to habitus . hospital course : by issue : 1. leave thigh cellulitis : the patient be start on ancef renally dose for her left thigh cellulitis . her leg be keep raised and her white blood cell and fever curve follow . an infectious disease consult as well a a dermatology consult be obtain to assist with antibiotic as well a dress for her low extremity change . blood culture and wound culture send do not reveal any organism . because of the patient 's very high white blood cell count , the id consult team be concern for the possibility of toxic shock syndrome ; therefore , clindamycin iv be also added to her regimen of antibiotic . also per id recommendation , stool culture be send for e. coli 0167 : h7 which be negative . although there be an initial fall in the patient's white count during the first several day of antibiotic , this white count subsequently begin rise again . this be associate with continued poor resolution of the pain in the patient 's left thigh and perhaps worsen erythema . because the patient 's left leg do not appear to be get good on antibiotic , a surgical consult be obtain to rule out a deeper seat infection in the patient 's thigh . imaging of the patient 's leg with mri be attempt but be unsuccessful secondary to the patient 's large size . a ct of both of her leg be obtain instead which reveal no evidence of an abscess in her left leg , however , it do incidentally detect a large effusion in the patient 's left knee . one week after admission the patient note acute worsening of the pain in her left knee . because of the know leave knee effusion , a concern for a septic knee joint be raise . a rheumatology consult be obtain . the left knee be tap use ultrasound guidance remove 20 cc of turbid knee fluid . study on the left knee effusion reveal 13 , 000 white blood cell with negative gram stain and negative crystal exam time 3. culture of the left knee fluid do not grow any organism . despite these finding , we be still concern that this be a partially treat septic joint give the patient have be on antibiotic for one week . for this reason an orthopedic consult be obtain and the patient be take to the or for possible debridement . on 6/19 the patient be take to the operating room where an abscess on the left lateral distal thigh be find and drain . a total of approximately 20 cc of pu be remove by dr. sudler . there be no connection between the pu collection and the left knee effusion . after the drainage , the patient 's clinical status improve dramatically with a decrease in her white count and increased mobility of her leg . she be continue on ancef iv and p.o . ofloxacillin which have be add for gram negative coverage . the clindamycin be subsequently discontinue . on the day prior to discharge the patient 's white blood cell count have fall to 10 , 000. she remain afebrile . 2. renal : on admission the patient be note to have a creatinine of 3.7 with a baseline know to be 0.6 in september of 1996. however , on search through the patient 's record it appear that the patient have be note to have increase proteinuria since september of 1996. the acute renal failure be initially think to be secondary to dehydration ; the patient be give iv hydration with no improvement in her creatinine . for that reason , a renal consult be obtain on the third day of admission . it be the impression of the renal service that the patient 's acute renal failure be likely multifactorial secondary to a combination of diabetic nephropathy , low albumin , volume loss secondary to diarrhea , infection , and medication which include nsaid as well a ace inhibitor . for that reason , the patient 's nephrotoxic medication , which include lisinopril and metformin , be discontinue . the patient's electrolytes and volume status be follow closely for the rest of the course of the hospitalization with continued gradual improvement . her creatinine peak at 4.7. on discharge the patient 's creatinine have resolve back to 2.2 . 3. right upper extremity swelling : on the day after the patient return from the operating room for the drainage of her left thigh , she be find to have new onset of swell in her right arm and breast . initially we be concern for the presence of a right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis . upper extremity non-invasive study be obtain which be negative for any clot . an echocardiogram be also obtain show no evidence of right heart dysfunction . a nuclear flow study be also attempt but be unsuccessful because of the failure to obtain venous access on the patient 's right arm . the leahgulf mary katon hospital team be also consult regard the use of heparin . however , give that the patient have poor access and have an anemia , it be decide that the patient would not be heparinized . her right upper extremity swelling be observe closely and with elevation of the right arm over the next few day gradually resolve without any complication . on the day prior to discharge a repeat right upper extremity ultrasound be obtain which reveal no evidence of blood clot in her right arm . 4. hematology : on admission the patient be find to have a low hematocrit with a low mvc . iron study be perform which reveal the likely presence of iron deficiency . for that reason the patient be place on iron sulfate 30 mg t.i.d . the patient be guaiac negative , thus rule out evidence of a chronic gi bleed . the patient 's anemia be also likely a reflection of her renal dysfunction . 5. gi : although the patient have experience some diarrhea prior to admission , her diarrhea resolve in the hospital . all of her stool study be negative . abdominal ultrasound reveal no abnormality in the patient 's liver or biliary system to account for the mild transaminitis find on admission . it be likely that the patient have a bout of viral gastroenteritis a few day prior to admission which resolve spontaneously . disposition : to hi health . discharge medication : ancef 1 gram iv q.8h . time 14 day . ofloxacin 200 mg p.o . b.i.d . time 14 day . lotrimin topical apply b.i.d . to toe and web of toe . nystatin powder topical b.i.d . apply to groin area . polysporin ointment topical apply to right pretibial ulcer with dress . iron sulfate 300 mg p.o . t.i.d . atenolol 50 mg q day . oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o . q.4h . p.r.n . pain . miracle cream p.r.n . colace 100 mg p.o . b.i.d . additional

illness : the patient be a 51 year-old morbidly obese black female with a history of restrictive lung disease , obstructive sleep apnea , recurrent low extremity deep venous thromboses require multiple hospitalization who be initially evaluate on march , 1996 for right knee pain . evaluation reveal a small right knee effusion consistent with mechanical derangement secondary to obesity . the tap be negative for crystal and have negative culture . the patient be initially suppose to go home , however due to inadequate support , she be kept overnight on the evening of september , 1996.

blood gas prior to intubation be 7.04 ph , pco2 137 and po2 of 85 and she be subsequently admit to the medical intensive care unit . past medical history : her past medical history be significant for a restrictive lung disease . past pulmonary function test reveal an fev of 1.8 which be in the 56th percentile and fev1 of 1.6 which be in the 59th percentile , tlc of 3.3 in the 54th percentile and dlco at 116th percentile . she have be on long term home oxygen with oxygen saturation between 85 % and 90 % on two liter of nasal cannula . arterial blood gas on prior admission have reveal po2 in 50 , pco2 in the high 40 to low 50 . she have a history of obstructive sleep apnea . she have be evaluate in the past with even trace apnea screen in august of 1994 which reveal approximately 19 apnea event in just over 10 hour . the oxygen saturation decrease to 61 % at the minimum and subsequently she have respiratory monitoring in september of 1995 with c-pap which reveal a decrease in the apnea episodes to 19 event in about 480 minute with oxygen saturation decrease to a minimum of 71 % . apparently , by report , attempt have be make to start the patient on the c-pap at home , but the patient have be resistant and she have a long history of medical non-compliance . she have a history of recurrent deep venous thromboses in which she have have multiple medical admission , most recently about six in the past year , most recently in october of 1996 , for cellulitis of the left low extremity , in july of 1996 , bilateral calf tenderness with negative non-invasive study and in september of 1996 , most recently with right low extremity cellulitis and this be complicate by apparent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare . the patient have have multiple vq scan in the past , all of which have be low probability . the patient have be on chronic coumadin , however there be a question of whether or not , she have be take it regularly . there have also be a question in the past of possible diastolic dysfunction . in september of 1994 , she have an echocardiogram which show some leave ventricular hypertrophy , no regional wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of approximately 55 % , no right ventricular hypertrophy or tricuspid regurgitation . other past medical history include a history of depression . the patient have be manage with zoloft 50 mg p.o . q. day . she be status post midline hernia repair . she be status post bilateral tubal ligation . the patient have chronic hypoxemia , obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , chronic low extremity

the patient live alone . she occasional have her son stay with her . she be divorce and she have refuse chronic care in the past . habit : positive for cigarette about a 20 pack year history . no alcohol , no intravenous drug . hospital course : 1 ) pulmonary : the patient be admit to the medical intensive care unit on march , 1996 status post a respiratory arrest think to be secondary to hypercarbia through the combination of the patient 's underlying lung disease as well a excessive sedation . she be intubate on march , 1996 and quickly extubated on april , 1996 without complication . her chest x-ray on admission be significant for a mild interstitial pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly . after extubation , the patient be wean to bi-pap with which she be able to maintain saturation between 86-90 % while in the medical intensive care unit . the patient be transfer to the floor on february , 1996. give the patient 's history of restrictive lung disease , it be think that it be time to have a full work-up to search for a possible etiology , question possible obesity vs. parenchymal disease . she have an echocardiogram on august , 1996 , which reveal an ejection fraction of 75 % , mild leave ventricular hypertrophy , no regional wall motion abnormality , a top normal size right ventricle , trace tricuspid insufficiency and a suggested pulmonary arterial pressure in the range of 36 mm of mercury plus the estimate right atrial pressure . this echocardiogram be perform with a bubble study and there be no obvious intra-cardiac shunt either by color doppler or saline infusion . they be unable to exclude diastolic dysfunction give the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy . her chest ct on august , 1996 be significant for cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema , patchy opacity in the right apex and lung base with a nodular quality of unclear etiology and a lucent lesion in the right lobe of the liver that be too small to characterize . in order to further help sort out the etiology of her restrictive lung disease , the patient underwent a pa gram on september , 1996 to rule out the possibility of chronic pulmonary embolus . this study reveal no evidence of pulmonary embolus . she have a normal pulmonary vascular distribution , elevate right heart pressure with pulmonary arterial pressure of 44/13 with a mean of 28 mm of mercury , right ventricular pressure 52/2 with a mean of 20 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23. the pulmonary service have be consult and it be think that it be difficult to sort out exactly what be go on . it be unclear what the nodular lesion describe on the ct represent , whether it be inflammation or some sort of firm nodule . it be decide to follow-up on the ct in the future and to have the patient have a repeat sleep study as well a repeat pulmonary function test . the overall impression be that her restrictive lung disease be most likely secondary to obesity . while the patient be on the floor , we attempt to restart her on the bi-pap , however the patient resist use both the c-pap and the bi-pap practically every night complain that she have an upper respiratory infection that make it difficult for her to wear the machine . on the evening that she do actually try both the c-pap and the bi-pap , she be note to have labor breathe with the c-pap at 5 mm of mercury and four liter nasal cannula with a pulse oximetry drop to 81 % . when she switch to bi-pap with setting of 12 mm of mercury inspiratory and 7 mm of mercury expiratory , she be able to maintain oxygen saturation between 88 % and as high a 93 % oxygen saturation . her oxygen saturation throughout hospitalization range between 91-93 % on two liter nasal cannula during the day and as well a 88 % overnight . it be decide that the patient give her history would require bi-pap on discharge as well a her home oxygen . 2 ) infectious disease : the patient a note above spike a temperature to 101 degree on march , 1996 while in the medical intensive care unit and subsequently never have elevate temperature nor an elevated white blood cell count . she be start on clindamycin

decide for the patient to either follow-up with her primary care physician or with the gyn clinic at n'ssciences memorial hospital for evaluation of this spot for rule out endometrial carcinoma . 9 ) neurological : the patient do not demonstrate any evidence of depression and be stable on zoloft . 10 ) general care : the patient underwent physical therapy and occupational therapy throughout the hospitalization . it be think that she would benefit greatly from inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation or possibly weight loss reduction , however the patient repeatedly decline pulmonary rehabilitation and weight loss reduction and felt that she would be able to manage herself at home . the patient be discharge on march , 1996 in stable condition to home with vna service to follow-up on her blood sugar , her home oxygen as well a her bi-pap . medication on discharge : 1 ) lasix 20 mg p.o . q. day . 2 ) glyburide 10 mg p.o . q. day . 3 ) procardia xl 30 mg p.o . q. day . 4 ) zoloft 50 mg p.o .

course : from the cardiac standpoint , we initially attempt to diurese him iv torsemide 200 mg b.i.d . however , he do not respond well enough to this regimen , and therefore we start drip with zaroxolyn p.r.n . we also stop his isordil and ace inhibitor early on because of blood pressure in the 80 . on admission , his creatinine be 2.0 and on the next day of admission , it be 2.2 with low blood pressure , at which point , we decide to start a low-dose dopamine drip at 2 mcg per hour . however , his urine output be only about 500 cc negative , so we further increase the lasix drip from 10 mg an hour to 20 mg an hour after 200 mg iv lasix bolus . on this combination of the lasix drip at 20 an hour and dopamine at 2 mcg per hour , he begin to have very good and effective urine output at approximately 2-3 liter per day , negative , also reflect in his total weight , and come in with admission weight of around 90 kg . on each day , he diuresed about an half to kilo off until the day of discharge , at which point , he be less than 86 kg . we monitor strict i 's and o 's , check daily weight . during the course of his diuresis , his sodium level be decrease mostly secondary to the patient drink a lot of free water . the combination of free water intake in the setting of natriuresis result in further worsening of his hyponatremia from an admission sodium of 128 to 124 , eventually to 122. we strictly reinforce the need to limit his fluid intake to less than 2 liter per day , and at that point , his sodium level than rebound to 124 and also 128 on the day of discharge . we monitor the b.i.d . lytes . eventually , his blood pressure remain stable . his jvp decrease from 18 to 20 on admission to about 10 to 12 and continue to have good urine output , thus we wean off the dopamine , but continue the lasix drip for one more day . we then discontinue the lasix drip and transition him back over to torsemide 200 b.i.d . p.o . , which be his home regimen and watch him for another 24 hour . he continue to diurese at this dose , but then on the day of discharge , his i 's and o 's be finally about 500 cc negative , which be a change from about 1 to 2 liter negative per day . his jvp be about 9 to 10 and his creatinine be stable at 1.7. we re-added his isordil at 10 mg t.i.d . for the last 24 hour and his blood pressure be stable in the 90 . give his potassium , which be always borderline low in the 33 or 35 range , we decide to increase his aldactone dose to 25 mg b.i.d . , but give his underlying renal insufficiency , we have decrease his stand k-dur from 40 meq a day to 20 meq a day . an echo be do , which show an ejection fraction of 20 % and 4+ mr. they do not comment on the synchrony on the preliminary report . however , he be a candidate for bi-v pacing give his mildly widen qrs complex stage iii heart failure and have be on a very good heart failure regimen up until this point . discharge medication : at discharge , his medical regimen consist of digoxin 0.125 mg once a day , torsemide 200 mg b.i.d . , aldactone 25 mg b.i.d . , isordil 10 mg t.i.d . , and k-dur 20 meq . we also add folate 5 mg to his regimen because he have an elevated homocystine level . he also take ambien at night p.r.n . for insomnia . disposition : he be be discharge to home with plan to follow up with dr. grassi in her thyroid clinic on 3/1/05 . he have be again urge to stop smoking and to be complaint with his regimen because he be a good heart transplant candidate and for the current time , he be not list give the aforementioned reason . overall , mr. plagmann state that his symptom have drastically improve . he no longer have orthopnea . he be able to exert himself much more without symptom of shortness of breath or lightheadedness ,

likely not in dka a the patient 's level of betahydroxybutyrate of 1.66 be not enought to explain the patient 's gap or all his metabolic disturbance . the endocrine service that more likely the patient have hyperglycemic , hyperosmolar , nonketotic acidosis and also severe pancreatitis . initial screen for the cause of pancreatitis be negative include stone . the patient have significant alcohol history and have be drink alcohol which be the most likely cause of his severe pancreatic insufficiency . the patient be aggressively hydrate with iv fluid and his metabolic abnormality begin to correct . he be also note by lab to be in acute renal failure and a renal consult be obtain . the patient 's nonoliguric renal failure be in the setting of severe dehydration secondary to

soft , solid diet with very low fat . i will dictate the rest of the patient 's event , assessment and plan by problem list a follow : 1. gi : i. severe pancreatitis : the patient be able to be advance to a soft solid diet for the past few day . she have abdominal pain which have almost resolve and then resume and the patient develop a watery diarrhea . it be felt that this could be due to pancreatic insufficiency versus c. diff colitis and therefore c. diff sample be send and the patient be presumptively start on flagyl and pancrease 12 , 000 unit t.i.d . 1/2 hour before meal . the patient 's abdominal pain and diarrhea persist . this prompt u to make the patient n.p.o . once more and another abdominal ct be obtain . an abdominal ct perform on 30 of march show progression of pancreatitis with increase inflammatory change . there be no necrosis or pseudocyst formation note . also note be some significant small bowel dilatation without any evidence of obstruction . therefore , the patient be continue to be keep n.p.o . and tpn be restart on 25 of april . the patient have tolerate this well and at this time have no longer have any abdominal pain either subjectively or on exam . it do occasionally have mild low back pain which be think to actually be due to his pancreatitis a oppose to any musculoskeletal cause . ii . diarrhea : the patient also have diarrhea a note above . he have be work up extensively . his diarrhea have now resolve . he be c. diff negative , but be treat presumptively with flagyl for seven day . all stool study include shigella , salmonella , campylobacter , ovum and parasite , microsporidia have be negative . his stool have be send for quantitative fecal fast which be still pending on discharge . he have be repeatedly guaiac negative . a note above his diarrhea have resolve . iii . resolve heme positivity : the patient earlier in the course of his intensive care unit stay have some stool that be heme positive . they be think to be due to gastritis . he have now be on initially , after that have be on prilosec and now change over to ranitidine in his tpn and have have multiple guaiac negative stool in the past ten day . iv . small perianal ulcer : the patient be note to have a small perianal ulcer . it be felt to be secondary to pressure from lie in bed and also secondary to his multiple episode of diarrhea which have be go on for day . it be felt that this should resolve . if it do not , it be suggest that the ulcer be swab and send for hsv . 2. endocrine : i. insulin dependent diabetes mellitus : due to the patient's pancreatic insufficiency , the patient will be a life long diabetic . the patient have be follow by the endocrine service and be now receive 45 unit of insulin per liter through his tpn . he be also on a slide scale regular regimen with finger stick q6h . it be felt that this should be a relatively stable regimen for him at this time . a the patient be wean off his tpn and start to take p.o . again , he should be switch over to nph b.i.d . with regular insulin check on a slide scale before his meal . the patient also have a follow-up appointment with the diabetes clinic in three week a noted below . 3. cardiovascular : the patient do have a history of congestive heart failure and have have mild bi-basilar crackle throughout his stay here . this have not limit him in any way . he have have a good oxygen saturation . the patient continue to take 40 mg of lasix p.o . q.d . on the day of discharge , he receive an extra 20 mg iv a he have be i & os positive for the last few day and we note a slightly more crackle on his exam . of note , the patient have a long history of have paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but have be do relatively well here . his current medical regimen include isordil 10 mg p.o . t.i.d . , captopril 6.25 mg p.o . t.i.d . both of these can be titrate upwards a his blood pressure allow . he have have some labile blood pressure range anywhere from the systolics of 80 to 130s while in the hospital and he have never be symptomatic and even when he have be , he have have blood pressure in the 80 and have tolerate this well . he be also maintain on digoxin 0.375 mg q.d . he be also take aspirin for his cardiac regimen . 4. pulmonary : the patient have good o2 saturation and usually range from 95 to 97 % on room air and have have no pulmonary problem . he have have bibasilar crackle on exam which be felt to be due to some mild congestive heart failure for which he be take lasix . he may need some extra dos of lasix per your direction the next few day . 5. heme : the patient 's hematocrit have be low in the high 20 on two occasion . in both case always drift down slowly think to be due to delutional effect plus repeat a phlebotomy . he have be transfuse a total of three unit while he have be in the hospital here . otherwise be hematocrit have be stable for multiple day so have his platelet . also of note the patient have be heme negative from below for more than ten day . 6. renal : the patient say his baseline creatinine in which his acute renal failure have resolve . 7. rhabdomyolysis : this have also resolve with the patient 's cks have normalize over a week ago . 8. infectious disease : the patient have remain afebrile , normal white count for many day . while here he be also presumptively treat for c. diff which be actually find to be negative on his stool examination with no fecal leukocyte . the patient's temperature curve should be follow give that the patient continue to have pancreatitis and be at risk for develop a phlegmon . assessment and plan : 1. severe pancreatitis : the patient continue to be on tpn . a picc line have be place and a triple lumen catheter will be remove prior to transfer of the patient . it be our feeling that the patient should remain on tpn for the next two day and then a per your direction , the patient could be slowly advance on a p.o . diet a tolerated . we feel that the patient deserve another trial to see if he can tolerate p.o . before any long term decision be make regard his nutrition and perhaps placement of a j-tube for long term feeding . the patient 's amylase and lipase on the day of discharge be 47 for amylase and 166 for lipase . these value continue to remain low even when the patient be have abdominal pain . this be felt to be due to a relatively burnt out pancreas . a gi consult be also obtain which agree with this assessment . it be felt that when the patient do start take p.o . again he should have pancreas at least 8 to 12 , 000 unit t.i.d . half hour before meal due to his pancreatic exocrine insufficiency . also the patient should be follow clinically very closely include his white count , fever curve and his abdominal exam for any sign and symptom of development of an infection or phlegmon or pseudocyst because of his pancreatitis . the patient 's tpn should be continue a noted below . 2. endocrine insufficiency : the patient , a note above , will require insulin , both through be tpn and his fingersticks should be check every six hour . a noted when the patient be switch over to a p.o . regimen , we suggest per endocrine recommendation that nph be give b.i.d . and the patient should be cover with an insulin slide scale at bedtime . the patient be be transfer to redist nalereamer memorial hospital on 2 of april in good condition . the patient today deny any abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , but occasionally continue to have mild back pain . his diarrhea have resolve . he be afebrile with a blood pressure of 120/70 , pulse be 69 , respiratory rate 16 , sit 97 on room air , with a weight of 69.0 kg . he be comfortable and have have bibasilar crackle of 1/4 the way up . his abdomen be soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sound . his extremity be without edema . on the day of discharge his white count be 8.8 , hematocrit be 36 , addplatelets of 348. his sma-7 be within normal limit with a creatinine of 0.6. his amylase be 47 and his lipase be 160. disposition : the patient be be discharge in good condition to lakesfic hospital medical center . his primary care physician dr. littmann be aware of the patient 's discharge and will continue to follow with his care . the patient also have an appointment with dr. sanislo in the diabetes clinic at longa ent no on 7 of january at 11 a.m. discharge medication : 1. aspirin 325 mg p.o . q.d . 2. albuterol inhaler two puff q.i.d . 3. digoxin 0.375 mg q.d . 4. lasix 40 mg p.o . q.d . 5. captopril 6.25 mg p.o . t.i.d . 6. isordil 10 mg p.o . t.i.d . 7. magnesium and potassium sliding scale through iv while be here . diet : the patient should remain n.p.o . for the next two day . his tpn order upon discharge should be a follow : he will have a total of 2 liter per day at a rate of 83.3 ml per hour constantly . he have a modified central solution of 5 % aminoacid , 18 % dextrose , 400 lipid

illness : the patient be a pleasant 78-year-old gentleman who present with shortness of breath and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for approximately three week . he have a history of coronary artery disease with an mi in 1994 and four-vessel cabg with subsequently place five stent in 2002 for graft and native vessel stenosis , hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.8 , diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent ) , hyperlipidemia , and a pace maker for symptomatic bradycardia . he be present with three week of increase orthopnea , dyspnea , and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with rare chest tightness without radiation and onset of symptom mainly while recumbent . he present after come to an outside hospital with three to four day of these worsen symptom . he be transfer to baspit hospital where he receive most of his cardiac care . the patient have these worsen heart failure symptom after a trip to i hwy , ny vale , michigan 34152 , some dietary indiscretion and a five-pound weight gain . he have have no syncope , palpitation , but have have some mild nausea without emesis . at the outside hospital when he present , his ekg show a baseline leave bundle-branch block and have a troponin of 0.13. he be give some lasix and have echocardiogram , have initially reveal an ejection fraction of 35 % . he be transfer to me ale firstray hospital , start on a nitroglycerin drip as well a a heparin drip for presumed coronary artery disease , a repeat echocardiogram show an ejection fraction of 50 % , anterior wall distal dyskinesis from an old myocardial infarction and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation . this be consistent with an echocardiogram that he receive in 1/8 . upon presentation , the patient be afebrile , have a heart rate of 82 , blood pressure of 138/64 and be sate 96 % on 5 liter of nasal canula . his jugular venous pressure be 7 cm . his lung have rale bilaterally , approximately half way up . he have no dullness . his heart be regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the left axilla . he have no s3 , and no s4 . his abdomen be mildly distended . he have no fluid wave

pattern and no significant st wave change and an occasional pvc . admission laboratory : significant for a creatinine of 3.1 , a bun of 76 , potassium of 5.3 , his hematocrit be 29.4 , and pt-t be 56 on heparin drip . brief resume of hospital course : 1. ischemia . the patient have an extensive history of coronary artery disease . he be maintain on aspirin , plavix , low dose beta-blocker with carvedilol as well a ace inhibitor and statin . he initially come in with a troponin of 0.13 , which be felt a demand ischemia relate to systemic hypertension and pulmonary hypertension . his enzyme trend down and be negative after the initial check . eventually , the patient receive 48 hour of intravenous heparin as well a iv nitroglycerin and be chest pain free . at this point , he receive an adenosine mibi nuclear study , which reveal a know distal anterior wall scar with a very small surround region of reversible ischemia that be felt to be nonrevascularizable . he be maintain on optimum medical management with the caveat that cardiac catheterization in this gentleman who have already have previous history of renal dysfunction with a creatinine rise to nearly 7 with a dye load be not warrant nor indicate at this time . by discharge , he be ambulate hall and be chest tightness free . coronary artery disease be felt to be a noncontributory factor to his chf exacerbation . 2. pump . the patient have an ejection fraction of 45 % upon admission with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation . he be initially diuresed approximately 3 liter with a combination of lasix and natrecor . at this point , his pulmonary edema have resolve and his oxygen requirement be decrease . give the fact of his tenuous renal status , we want to avoid further diuresis or after-load reduction until we know exactly what his right and leave heart filling pressure be . the patient be take to the cardiovascular diagnostic laboratory and receive a right heart catheterization . his pulmonary capillary wedge pressure be determine to be 16 and his pulmonary artery pressure 56/18 . his ra pressure be 8. there be some initial false elevation because of inadequate sedation while in the cath lab , and the patient be transfer for 48 hour of tailored therapy to the cardiac care unit where he have a pulmonary artery catheter in place . at this point , his after-load reduction be maximize with combination of hydralazine and isordil with good effect . his creatinine decrease with after-load reduction to 2.7. his symptom improve and we be able to diurese another 2 liter of the patient . by discharge , the patient be actually become hypertensive again and he be start on amlodipine , a calcium channel blocker , which he have tolerate in the past . of note , the patient have be expose to ace inhibition in the past and be currently not on an ace inhibitor . in the past , he have have a rise in his potassium to 5.5 on ace inhibition . on an outpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient have a trial of ace or arb to optimize his after-load reduction and neurohormonal activation with his heart failure . the patient's heart failure regimen include stand lasix , carvedilol , isordil and hydralazine , as well a digoxin for symptomatic improvement . 3. rhythm . the patient have a dual-chambered pacemaker . he be maintain on telemetry throughout his hospital stay . his electrolyte be replete and he be on a low-dose beta-blocker . he have a few round of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia less than 8 beat every time during his hospital stay . the patient be not at this time a candidate for resynchronization biventricular pacer therapy because his ejection fraction of 45 % , even if his qrs interval be great than 150 ms. 4. pulmonary . give the fact that the patient have a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and elevate pulmonary artery pressure , a brief investigation of pulmonary parenchymal disease be undertaken . he have a high resolution chest ct , which show mild ground glass infiltrate at the base consistent with pulmonary edema and no evidence of interstitial process . he also have pulmonary function test . pulmonary function test reveal an fvc of 1.88 liter and an fev1 of 1.33 liter . this give an fev1 to fvc percent of 71 % . he have both decrease fvc and fev1 , but an fev1 and fvc percent that be most consistent with a mild restriction . his lung volume be approximately 50 % predict suggestive of a restrictive process and his dlco both correct and uncorrected be 50 % predict . his corrected dlco be 13.5. it be unclear if the patient have underlie restrictive lung disease give the absence of definitive interstitial process on high resolution chest ct. a more likely explanation for these finding be a residual pulmonary edema relate to inadequate diuresis with his congestive heart failure . the patient be sate 98 % on room air at the time of discharge . 5. endocrine . the patient have very difficult to control diabetes mellitus , and be maintain on both nph and lispro slide scale while in house . he be briefly hypoglycemic during his initial hospital course because of a urinary tract infection . this resolve after approximately 24 hour of hold his long-acting insulin and give him glucose replacement therapy . he be euglycemic on 15 and 10 of nph in the a.m. and p.m. respectively as well a a lispro scale at the time of discharge . furthermore , the patient be find to have a tsh of 0.219 as well a a normal t4 , this be suggestive of clinical hypothyroidism , which be consistent with over replacement with synthroid such a maintenance synthroid dose be decrease from 75 mcg to 60.5 mcg and we recommend a tsh to be check in late february 2004 . 6. renal . the patient have baseline chronic renal insufficiency presumably due to a combination of diabetes and hypertension . he have have adverse reaction to contrast dye in the past with a creatinine bump to nearly 7. we want to avoid as much contrast dye a possible during this hospital stay because of his renal insufficiency . we end up re-dosing his digoxin to three time weekly from every other day because of the dig level of 0.19. his creatinine be 2.7 and fall at the time of discharge and his bun be 67. he be make good urine and have no evidence of residual urinary tract infection . 7. infectious disease . upon presentation , the patient after a foley be place become a little delirious and hypoglycemic . urine culture grow out great than 100 , 000 colony of serratia marcescens and he be give a 14-day course of renally dose levofloxacin with good resolution of his symptom . 8. neuropsych . the patient have a history of depression and have some mild delirium in the setting of urinary tract infection , which resolve with p.r.n . zyprexa as well a treating of the underlying condition . psychiatric service be consult and felt like he have a resolve medical delirium and there be no indication for further pharmacal or psychodynamic therapy at this time . ( his mild subclinical hyperthyroidism may have contribute to his low mood a apathetic hyperthyroidism in a gentleman of this age be not uncommon . ) 9. prophylaxis . the patient be maintain on nexium for gi prophylaxis and subcutaneous heparin for dvt prophylaxis . code status : the patient be full code . the patient be consult by both physical therapy and occupational therapy who felt that acute rehabilitation would be warrant at this time . disposition : the patient be discharge in stable condition on room air and be chest pain free to the irbar medical center the patient 's health care proxy be his wife , mrs. blake maker , whose phone number be ( 158 ) 000-3426. he will be follow by dr. valentine cloer at as medical center schedule appointment with dr. jo ( 703 ) 219-1739. the patient 's primary care physician be dr. arthur widener at ( 865 ) 227-2987. the patient should be maintain on a fluid-restricted diet of less than 2 liter of fluid total . he should have low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat as well a a diabetic diet with ada 2100 calorie per day . he should also be sodium restrict to less than 2 g daily . activity to be guide by physical therapy at none to do : 1. titrate amlodipine p.r.n . the patient have tolerate up to 10 mg amlodipine in the past . 2. consider outpatient trial of ace inhibitor or arb in the future with close monitoring of potassium . 3. recheck tsh late february 2004 . 4. complete former day of antibiotic for serratia urinary tract infection . discharge condition : stable . discharge medication : 1. tylenol 650 mg p.o . q.4h . p.r.n . headache . 2. vitamin c 500 mg p.o . t.i.d .

patient be a 54 year old gentleman with a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus , obesity , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting and pacemaker placement in 1996 and 1999 respectively , who present on 7/16/2000 with a four day history of cough , fever , chill , myalgia and leave eye pain . the patient also note over the course of four day prior to admission , that his p.o . intake have be decrease . he have be experience nausea and vomit without diarrhea and fever to 103 degree . on the day of admission the patient note the sudden onset of vision loss in his left eye associate with redness and pain . in the emergency room the patient be give diamox , aspirin and nitropaste in response to t-wave inversion anteriorly on his electrocardiogram . in addition , the patient be culture and start on broad spectrum antibiotic include ceftriaxone , azithromycin and gentamycin . physical exam : vital sign : temperature 99.2 ,

function study otherwise normal . ck 169 , troponin 1.7 , cbc show a white blood cell count of 5.5 , hematocrit 33 , platelet 51. electrocardiogram show paced rate of 60 with t-wave inversion of v1-v6 . chest x-ray show cardiomegaly with vascular redistribution . no focal infiltrates note . ct of the head show no evidence of acute bleed . urinalysis essentially negative . hospital course : 1. infectious disease : the patient be initially treat with broad spectrum antibiotic in the emergency room and be rapidly note to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 72. the patient be hydrate aggressively and consistently pan culture . the patient begin to spike fever from 100 to 101 range . on the second hospital day , the patient grow 4/4 bottle of what turn out to be group b streptococcus . the patient 's antibiotic be change to penicillin and gentamycin . a transesophageal echocardiogram be perform on the day of admission and do not demonstrate any vegetation , however with persistent high spike fever , sepsis and 4/4 blood culture bottle , repeat blood culture grow gbs the patient have repeat transesophageal echocardiogram . this demonstrate a 1.5x1.0 centimeter vegetation on the anterior annulus of the tricuspid valve and it be also note to be hit the pacemaker wire though not fix to it . of note , the bubble study on the echocardiogram be negative for patent foramen ovale . the patient present complaining of left eye pain and loss of vision on the night of admission in the emergency room , the ophthalmologist saw the patient and determine that the patient have an elevated pressure . the elevated pressure be treat and he respond well by the following day . at that time the patient's eye be aspirate and note to also be infect by gb . the patient be inject intraocular with vancomycin at that time . unfortunately the patient continue to spike fever despite appropriate therapy for his gb and his eye appear to be worsen with continued erythema , conjunctival edema and a purulent exudate . it be determine that the patient would require enucleation which he undergo on 5/10/2000 . the patient also have a right low extremity cellulitis during his hospital course . this be treat with a ten day course of dicloxacillin and resolve without complication . the patient's course be complicate by persistent fever despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and leave eye enucleation . an extensive work up be undertake to evaluate the fever include evaluation for possible epidural abscess , psoas abscess and infected joint . none of these prove to be a source . the patient underwent multiple joint aspiration ( see musculoskeletal section below ) without clear evidence of infection . the patient also undergo a tagged white blood cell scan which demonstrate increase uptake in the left shoulder , manubrium , right knee , leave ankle and mid shaft of the left tibia . these be interpret both on the initial view and delayed view a consistent with acute inflammation but not diagnostic of infection . a mention above the patient be also treat for cellulitis and underwent leave eye enucleation . the patient 's fever curve trend down throughout the hospital stay and on the day prior to admission , the patient underwent a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram to ensure that there be no myocardial abscess . there be no evidence of any abscess and the vegetation be no longer visible . it be felt that the low grade fever be secondary to ongoing inflammation but no acute infectious process at the time of discharge . the patient 's last positive blood culture be 4/3/2000 . of note , there be concern that the patient 's fever could be secondary to a drug reaction . therefore once the infectious work up be complete , the penicillin be change to vancomycin . his gram positive coverage will need to be continue for four week after his left eye enucleation . 2. ophthalmology : a describe above , the patient present with left eye pain and vision loss . it be felt from the time of presentation that the patient would not recover vision in his left eye . the patient be treat initially for his elevated pressure and then the following day his eye be aspirate and inject with vancomycin . ultimately the patient have leave eye enucleation . the patient 's eye heal well through the remainder of his hospital course and do not appear to be a source of infection thereafter . the patient 's extraocular muscle be leave intact with the thought of place a prosthesis at a late date . 3. cardiovascular : on admission the patient be note to have t-wave inversion anteriorly on his electrocardiogram . however it rapidly become clear that his pacemaker be malfunction demonstrate only occasional pacing spike . by 6/24/2000 the pacemaker be no longer capture or sense . a mention above , the wire do not appear to be incorporate in the vegetation note on the tricuspid valve however it do appear that the vegetation be hit the pacemaker wire with systole and diastole . on 6/13/2000 the patient underwent pacemaker explantation without complication . the indication for pacemaker placement have be for bradycardia . there be some concern throughout the patient 's hospital course that the patient would become bradycardic without his pacemaker in place however this never manifest a a problem . he do demonstrate some run of ventricular tachycardia during the early phase of his hospital course but this resolve a his sepsis resolve . he do have one episode of supraventricular tachycardia think to be 1-1 conduction of his atrial arrhythmia . his lopressor be increase in response to this and the patient be tolerate this dose without episode of bradycardia or hypotension . the patient a mention above , undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram at the time of admission which demonstrate an ejection fraction of 35 percent , apical hypokinesis , moderately dilate right ventricle with moderately depress systolic function . mild inferior vena cava dilatation consistent with elevated right heart filling pressure . the patient 's cardiac function appear to be stable throughout his hospitalization . he do rule out for myocardial infarction at the time of admission . 4. musculoskeletal : one of the patient 's major present complaint be significant arthralgia and myalgia . it be though that along with left ophthalmitis , the patient could have septic polyarthritis . the patient underwent several arthrocentesis by the rheumatology service . though the fluid do demonstrate elevate white blood cell count it be never clear that these be acutely infect . there be no bacteria on gram stain or culture . the patient 's right knee continue to be tender , erythematous and warm during the initial part of the hospitalization . therefore the patient go to arthroscopic examination on 7/16/2000 . the patient 's knee be lavaged with 9 liter of sterile saline prior to close all of the effusion be drain . there be no complication . the patient continue to have symptom of right knee effusion and pain and therefore return to the operating room on 10/28/2000 for repeat arthrocentesis . since that time the right knee have reaccumulated a moderate size effusion but the patient have tolerate physical therapy and have regain a moderate amount of his range of motion . it be determine that the patient should not have this effusion drain again because it be no long warm or erythematous . the left shoulder be also quite tender during the initial hospital stay . the patient underwent multiple joint aspiration of the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint , both at the bed side and under fluoroscopic examination . again , this joint demonstrate elevated white blood cell count but never any clear evidence that it be a septic joint . the patient after his left eye enucleation , be note to have an elevated ck of 1522. it be think that this be an insignificant mb fraction . it be not felt that there be enough manipulation to skeletal muscle during the enucleation to warrant this . this rise in ck do coincide with increased muscle ache . it be felt that the patient perhaps have a mild episode of rhabdomyolysis which resolve quickly to a ck of 177 five day later . at the time of discharge the patient be experience no myalgia or arthralgia with the exception of the right knee which be still somewhat limited in it range of motion and demonstrate an effusion but be respond well to rehabilitation . 5. pulmonary : the patient be quite stable from a pulmonary standpoint throughout his hospitalization . the patient be initially maintain in the emergency room on high flow oxygen however be quickly wean to nasal cannula and then room air . the patient do have obstructive sleep apnea and use his bipap at night throughout his hospitalization . 6. hematology : on admission the patient demonstrate a thrombocytopenia with a nadir of 51. this have improve throughout his hospital course and on the day of discharge his platelet be note to be 538. the patient be note to have hematocrit that trend down and correspond to some guaiac positive stool with anticoagulation . the patient receive a total of four unit of packed red blood cell . his hematocrit have remain stable with a good reticulocyte count at the time of discharge . the patient be anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation initially with heparin and then ultimately with coumadin 10 mg p.o . q h . the patient 's inr have be therapeutic in the 2-3 range for approximately five day . 7. renal : on admission the patient be note to have an elevate creatinine from his baseline of 1.0. this be think to be secondary to dehydration and prerenal azotemia . the patient's creatinine reach a peak of 3.0 and stabilize at 1.3 at the time of discharge . this appear to have resolve entirely with resolution of sepsis and rehydration . 8. fluids/electrolytes/nutrition : the patient be significant dehydrate at the time of admission . this respond rapidly to in vitro fertilization . he also regain his appetite a his sepsis resolve . the patient be note however to have a very poor albumen , which be 2.3 at the time of discharge . the patient will require improved nutrition at rehabilitation and after discharge from rehabilitation . the patient 's electrolyte be relatively stable throughout his hospital stay . 9. endocrine : the patient have a long stand history of type ii diabetes mellitus . on admission , he be take metformin 1000 mg p.o . b.i.d . , regular insulin 10 q a.m. and 10 q p.m. , nph insulin 25 q a.m. and 20 q p.m. his hemoglobin a1-c be note to be elevate at 8.1 in 11/15 the patient 's metformin be hold throughout his hospital stay with the anticipation of possible invasive procedure . he be maintain and nph insulin as well a slide scale insulin . the patient be restart on his metformin prior to discharge and increase dose of nph insulin . this will likely need to be adjust a the patient recover far . 10. gastrointestinal : the patient do develop guaiac positive stool during his anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation . this will need to be follow up a an outpatient once the patient have make a full recovery from the acute event . also the patient do demonstrate a mild transaminitis during his hospital stay and this appear to have resolve with the transition from penicillin to vancomycin for his antibiotic regimen . medication on discharge : colace 100 mg p.o . b.i.d . , ilotycin 0.5 % topical t.i.d . over left eyelid , lasix 160 mg p.o . b.i.d .

right gluteal hematoma secondary to supratherapeutic anticoagulation . hospital course by problem be a follow : 1. right gluteal hematoma . the patient be admit for low hematocrit in the setting of be on multiple anticoagulant and antiplatelet drug . he be find to have right gluteal hematoma which be responsible for his acute hematocrit drop . his coumadin , lovenox , aspirin , and plavix be initially hold . he receive vitamin k and three unit of ffp to reverse his coagulopathy . he be also transfuse a total of 6 unit of prbcs for a goal hematocrit of 30 give his cardiac and neurologic disease a describe below . there be no evidence of further hematocrit drop . give that he have be anticoagulated due to right upper extremity dvt and that the indication for anticoagulation in the setting and catheter associate clot be somewhat murky , it be felt that the patient would not benefit from addition of anticoagulation and therefore his lovenox and coumadin be discontinue . he be restart on his aspirin and and his plavix and his hct remain stable . 2. non-st-elevation mi . the patient be admit in august and be know to have three-vessel coronary disease and have underwent stenting of his lad with a bare metal stent on 6/28/06 . after discussion with the cardiologist , he be stop on aspirin and plavix give the evolution of hematoma and his acute hematocrit drop . during his low hematocrit period , the patient be note to have lateral st depression and this correspond to a troponin leak with a peak troponin of 2.46. the etiology of this be felt to be demand relate to his profound anemia and on correction of his anemia , the patient 's st depression resolve fully and his troponins trend downward . the patient be know to have a presumed ischemic cardiomyopathy follow his nonst elevation mi . he be find to have an ejection fraction of 30-35 % . he will need to have a repeat echocardiogram do in one month 's time to assess whether or not he would benefit from an implantable cardiac defibrillator . the patient 's blood pressure medication be adjust a follow . his blood pressure medication be initially hold due to his stroke-like symptom at the time of admission when his low hematocrit . a detailed below , however , they be slowly add back . he tolerate slow titration of beta-blocker to goal heart rate and also addition of an ace inhibitor which be felt to be important give his extensive peripheral vascular disease and his low ejection fraction . 3. recrudescence of stroke-like symptom in the setting of the patient 's acute hematocrit drop . the patient be note to have worsen slur speech and a right facial droop . he do carry a history of left internal carotid occlusion and left-sided stroke in the past . the neurology team be consult for these acute deficit and request an mri . the mri show basically old know stroke and a subacute right internal capsule stroke that be felt to be unrelated to his current symptomatology . he initially have his antihypertensive to allow for maximal perfusion pressure . however , a his coagulopathy resolve , it be felt that the stress that result in the recrudescence of his old stroke-like symptom be resolve and he be able tolerate , further addition of his antihypertensive without further incident . disposition : the patient be see by physical therapy and give his recent below the knee amputation , it be felt to be best serve by go back to rehab . discharge medication : his discharged medication be a follow : 1. tylenol 650 mg q.4h . p.r.n . pain . 2. aspirin 325 mg daily . 3. colace 100 mg

the patient be an tuhamc patient . her primary cardiologist be dr. pegram history of present illness : ms. flora be a 50-year-old woman with coronary artery disease and extensive vascular disease who present to the ed with worsen chest pain at rest and at baseline have exertional chest pain . she have be experience increase chest pain of late and be refer to ct surgery for surgical evaluation to correct her cad and ischemia . she have be at an office visit on the date of admission with dr. rudicil and begin to experience terrible chest pain and dr. nacke refer her to the clare taho medical center ed for an urgent evaluation . in the ed , she be note to be afebrile with a temperature of 98 , blood pressure 91/54 , respiration 16 , and satting 98 % on 2 liter . she be note on ekg to be in normal sinus rhythm with 2-mm st depression in ii , iii , and avf v4 through v6 . she be give aspirin , morphine , metoprolol , mucomyst , ativan , nitroglycerin and be make pain-free and be send to the cath lab for the concern that her stent to the diagonal # 1 place 6/21/04 be no longer patent , a a cause for her unstable angina . she have be recently tell that no further intervention be possible after her stent to the diagonal # 1. past medical history : significant for coronary artery disease status post cabg in 1996 , which involve lima to lad ( free ) and svg to om1 . peripheral vascular disease . status post fem-pop and fem-fem bypass in 2003. end-stage renal disease status post cadaveric renal transplant in 1987 , currently immunosuppressed . iddm , hyperlipidemia ,

plavix 75 mg q. day as well a zetia 10 mg a day . allergy : sulfa , benadryl , penicillin , and compazine . social history : she live with her husband and have two child . hospital course : on admission , ms. ameling be take to the cardiac catheterization suite where it be find that her circumflex be 60 % , which have be 60 % stenosis , now 100 % stenosed . her diagonal # 1 status post stent be now 100 % stenosed and all other native disease and graft disease be unchanged . her right heart cath reveal elevated filling pressure and ptca and stent be carry out of the occluded diagonal # 1 stent as well a the lad , but she become hypotensive , bradycardic , and develop cardiogenic shock require cpr and intubation . she have an ibp place and subsequently an echo be do to rule out effusion and be negative , but have an apparently low ef . she have suspect transient decrease in flow to her septal artery and this likely compound her acute myocardial infarction . follow insertion of the intraaortic balloon pump , it be note that she have absent pulse in her right foot , which be note also to be cool to touch . she be transfer to the ccu , intubate and sedate , unresponsive . physical examination : her jvp be elevate . her lung have coarse breath sound anterolaterally , but without crackle or wheeze . her heart be regular , tachycardic with a gallop and a 3/6 harsh systolic murmur at the base of her heart and a 2/6 holosystolic murmur radiate to the axilla . she have somewhat decreased bowel sound , but her belly be soft and nondistended . her bilateral low extremity be cool with absent pulse in her foot to palpation and her right foot be mottle and be notably cooler without edema . laboratory data : her ck be over 100 , mb 7 , troponin 0.92 , inr 0.9 , and platelet 191 , 000. she later develop acute renal failure and dialysis be initiate on monday , wednesday , and friday schedule . her echo show an ef of 30 % with severe mr as well a inferoseptal and inferior akinesis . the balloon pump be eventually take out , the dopamine drip be discontinue . she be stabilize and extubated . she be stable for several day , but on 9/1/04 in the evening experience an episode of unstable vt arrest require shock x 1. no further defibrillation be need . she stabilize after her v-tach arrest and shocking and per electrophysiology service , she be load with amiodarone and have be continue on 200 mg p.o . q.6h . after be titrate off her amiodarone drip . by system : 1. cardiovascular : a. ischemia : ms. quigg have terrible coronary artery disease and no further intervention can be offer to her after discussion with both dr. kohler 's surgical team and the ep service . she should not undergo any further catheterization or revascularization . she be currently on aspirin , plavix , lopressor , and zocor . she be briefly on lipitor , but this be discontinue after a bump in her lfts . she be not on an ace or an arb secondary to her acute renal failure and at the time of this dictation her renal function remain poor and there be no plan to restart an ace inhibitor or arb . b. pump : ms. livernoche have ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe mr and she be undergoing ultrafiltration and regularly be get several liter per hemodialysis session a her blood pressure tolerate . c. rhythm : ms. mcelhiney have an episode of ischemic and unstable ventricular tachycardia require shock . electrophysiology evaluate her for the possibility of an aicd placement , but this have be defer for now and it be unlikely that she will ever have an aicd place , certainly not on this hospitalization . she have be load with amiodarone and be currently on 800 mg a day , split into 200 mg q.6h . p.o . and after 10 day she should be change to 200 mg p.o . b.i.d . this will take place on february she initially tolerate amiodarone very poorly secondary to nausea , so her dose be titrate up gradually . c. peripheral vascular disease : ms. fassett have extensive peripheral vascular disease and vascular surgery be follow her for a likely compartment syndrome in her right calf secondary to ischemia upon insertion of intraaortic balloon pump . she be have the circumference of her cath measure once or twice a day and these have not be increase , have in fact be decrease . also , her creatinine kinase level have be follow a a surrogate for compartment syndrome and these have be decrease and be currently normal . at the time of this dictation , her ck be 75 down from the 10 , 000 range . she be on heparin for some time and although her cath continue to be tender , the pain have improve and the function have gradually return . her pulse remain poor . she have low extremity noninvasive doppler to evaluate her arterial venous flow and no clot be note in the venous circulation . there be no comment make on the fem-fem graft , however , but no note be make of an arterial clot . she should have the circumference of her right calf follow closely at the place that they be mark on the right low extremity . 2. renal : ms. barrete have acute on chronic renal failure . she be admit with a creatinine of 2.7 and her creatinine have be up and down depend on the timing of her dialysis ; however , she be relatively anuric , but occasionally produce small volume of urine and this should be follow carefully as well . she be continue on prednisone and azathioprine for her transplant and she do have one positive ua , but this be not be treat because it be difficult to assess secondary to her extremely concentrated urine , but should be follow if she do produce urine . this may be permanent , but it be not clear at this point she may be on hemodialysis indefinitely . she be on fluid restriction per renal recommendation of 1000 cc per day intake and her arb be be hold for now . 3. id : ms. helmy spike on 11/5/04 to 101.8 and she have be find to have a line infection with a positive triple-lumen catheter tip as well a positive blood culture . she be start on vancomycin on 4/7/04 and this be be dose accord to her vancomycin trough , which be draw once a day . if her trough be near or below 15 she should be give one dose of vancomycin and this have turn out to be approximately every other day . 4. heme : ms. kornn 's platelet have be drop from the 100 to the mid 50 since she be start on amiodarone . it be not clear what the source be . she have have two negative hit antibody , platelet factor iv antibody , and her platelet seem to have stabilize in the high 40 , mid 50 and she be not show any sign of acute bleed , but this have be communicate with electrophysiology service who be aware of the possibility that amiodarone may be cause her thrombocytopenia and the amiodarone have be continue unless her thrombocytopenia worsen significantly . she be also on a number of other medication that may cause thrombocytopenia and these will be follow a well , however , it be only the amiodarone for which the timing be coincident with the drop in her platelet . 5. pulmonary : ms. wenrich have a large right pleural effusion ; it be tap on 10/14/04 , 600 cc be remove . it be note to be transudative . the tap be complicate by the patient slip off her bed during the procedure . she be catch and do not fall , but the pleural effusion be not completely drain and she develop a small hydropneumothorax . this should be follow . she also have a ct subsequently to rule out hemothorax and there be no evidence of that . the pleural effusion be evident on her chest x-rays with underlying consolidation . there have be no compromise , however , in her apparent pulmonary status and this should be follow since it will likely reaccumulate after tap , but if she become more symptomatic it should be tap . 6. ms. delperdang be on prednisone . for her diabetes , she be on nph and an insulin slide scale . 7. she experience an increase in her lfts , her transaminase bump to several 100 , and her total bilirubin peak at 1.8 , her alkaline phosphatase also bump , however , this may have be secondary to the start lipitor and this be discontinue . they have trend down since then . it be not clear exactly the source of her increase in lfts . she have be restart on zocor at a very low dose at 10 mg and this should be titrate up a her lfts tolerate . she be on zocor a an outpatient and we hope that this be not a class effect and that it be not go to be relate to the dose of her zocor . 8. gi : her nausea should be treat with p.r.n . ativan and zofran . she have a compazine allergy . 9. code status : ms.

4 , and her coagulation study range from an inr of 1.2 to 1.4. when she be admit to postpartum , her inr be 1.1 , and the day before discharge from the hospital , her coagulation study be find to be normal with an inr of 1.1 and fibrinogen of 377. her platelet become an area of concern when she present with a platelet level that be find to be fluctuate between 90 and 185. in the initial presentation after her postpartum hemorrhage . her platelet while in the medical intensive care unit go to as low a 57 , and this be felt to be possibly a component of her hellp syndrome versus dilution from her blood product resuscitation also part of her dic consumptive coagulopathy . although her dic consumptive coagulopathy have evidence that it have resolve , her platelet remain low and reach another low postoperative # 7 when they become 69. a hematology consult be obtain to evaluate the possible cause of her low platelet , and she undergo an extensive evaluation include a negative anticardiolipin and a negative lupus anticoagulant . the impression be one of low platelet secondary to shock liver in addition to dic in addition to dilution with marked amount of blood product , especially in the setting of the hematocrit range from the 49 to 50 range at that time . her platelet continue to improve throughout the hospital course and her platelet upon discharge be 144 and have trend up from the low of 69. her hematocrit initially be find to be very high , upon presentation at 51. this be consistent with hemoconcentration with a trough to as low a 26 while in the medical intensive care unit . follow her resuscitation , it go to as high a 61. on postoperative day # 7 , however , it drop from 46 to 40 and then drop again to 37.5 upon repeat check . this be of concern but 2 subsequent hematocrit be stable in the 39 range . her final hematocrit on the day of discharge be 39.5. this drop hematocrit be discover in the setting of a rectus muscle hematoma that will be deal with elsewhere in the dictation but her hematocrit be stable upon discharge . 3. gi . upon presentation , ms. neeb have evidence of increase lfts . while in the medical intensive care unit , she be find to have an ast of 177 , alt of 124 , and total bilirubin of 6.2. these elevate liver enzyme in the setting of her low platelet be suspicious for possible hellp syndrome . these lfts continue to improve with the ast and alt drop down to the normal limit . upon discharge , she be appreciate to have an alt of 37 and ast of 48. her bilirubin , however , continue to increase from 6.2 to as high a 11.2. in the setting of her increase bilirubin while the other lfts continue to improve , a gi consul be obtain , and she undergo a right upper quadrant ultrasound two time , once while on the labor floor and once while on the postpartum floor . both of these reveal a normal liver , normal biliary tree , as well a normal-sized spleen . in the setting of a normal nonobstructive picture , the gi consult have the impression that the increased bilirubin be secondary to her shock liver as well a the multiple blood transfusion and possible sepsis . they be confident that this would continue to improve but would likely take 2 to 3 week . upon discharge , her total bilirubin have begin to decrease to 8.2. she do manifest evidence of jaundice that be improve through the hospital course . on postoperative day # 9 , ms. culp develop a marked increase in her amylase and lipase . this be check in the setting of increase right upper quadrant pain that ultimately resolve . her lipase be elevate to as high a 438 to 474. gi be again reconsulted and have the impression that she do not suffer from pancreatitis give that she have no nausea or vomiting , be tolerate a regular diet , and have resolve abdominal pain . they felt that this be likely secondary to post-surgical change and be not an aggressive process that may need further treatment . an abdominal pelvic ct also demonstrate a normal pancreas without any evidence of strand or pseudocyst formation . the overall impression of the obstetrics team be that her constellation of acute-onset dic associate with hyperbilirubinemia and low platelet be all consistent with a potential diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy . this diagnosis be one that can be best make by a liver biopsy and discussion with the gi service reveal that they do not feel strongly that she need a liver biopsy . the gi service be skeptical with regard to the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy despite the clinical hallmark be manifest in this patient . they felt a if her symptom could be adequately explain by the degree of shock liver and postpartum hemorrhage that she experience . it be unclear a to whether or not she have acute fatty liver of pregnancy , but give the risk of recurrence , she will be counsel a an outpatient with regard to future pregnancy and management of these pregnancy , give her history of potential acute fatty liver of pregnancy . 4. incision . on postoperative day # 10 , she develop a dark blood ooze from a 2-mm portion on the right aspect of her pfannenstiel incision . this be concern for a possible subcutaneous hematoma . so an abdominopelvic ct be obtain on postoperative day # 10 that show evidence of an 8 x 5 cm right rectus hematoma that may have have an area of track through the fascia into the subcutaneous space . it be felt that this could undergo dress daily , and would ultimately seal up and stop bleeding . she be discharge home with vna daily dressing change and plan to reassess the incision at her followup postpartum appointment in 4 day from the date of discharge . of note , this right rectus hematoma be diagnose in the setting of a drop in her hematocrit from 46 to 40. her hematocrit remain stable for 2 additional day at 39.5 . 5. infectious disease . on postoperative day # 0 , follow her stat cesarean section . she have a t-max of 101.9 in the medical intensive care unit , and ampicillin , gentamicin , and clindamycin as well a levoflox ofloxacin be start on iv and be continue for 6 day until ultimately her blood culture grow out no organism . the urine culture be negative and her placenta culture also demonstrate only staphylococcus coagulase negative with a gram 's stain show no organism . she remain afebrile for the remainder of her hospital course and be not discharge on antibiotic . 6. endocrine . initially follow her medical intensive care unit admission , her blood sugar remain low throughout the day despite her eating habit . her blood sugar would get as slow a the 40 and as high a the 80 . this be perplex a she be know to be type 2 diabetic who initially be manage on metformin prepregnancy . an endocrine consult be obtain . the concern be for possible addisonian crisis and cord stimulation test be normal as well a a.m. and p.m. cortisol level be check . these remain within normal limit , and the concern for possible sheehan syndrome secondary to her massive postpartum hemorrhage be largely exclude . a tsh as well a an acth level where both drawn , and her tsh be 1.05 in the normal range and the acth test be 51 , within the normal range . of note , her blood sugar do trend up near the end of her hospital course . on postoperative day # 10 , she be find to have fast sugar in the 120 . she be restart on nph 10 unit daily . q.p.m . and q.a.m . as well a her humalog slide scale a.c. she be discharge home with prescription for nph as well a her humalog and will follow her sugar . these will be follow up by her endocrinologist dr. kuk within 4 day of this discharge . 7. renal . while in the medical intensive care unit , she suffer acute renal failure with a creatinine that go as high a 2.1. this improve to 1.0 upon discharge . of note , she have a decreased sodium appreciate on postoperative day # 7. urinary electrolyte be draw and fractional excretion of sodium be appreciate to be 0.32 consistent with prerenal , and the urine osmolality be 400 consistent with concentrated urine that may or may not have be consistent with syndrome of inappropriate adh . she underwent fluid restriction for 3 day and her sodium improve from 129 to 134 upon discharge . 8. pulmonary . immediately follow her vfib arrest , she be complain of severe rather shortness of breath and be intubate on the first attempt . at this time , intubate and sedate , she be in the micu and be extubated on postoperative day # 2. she be transition to nasal cannula after be on fio2 of 80 % and ultimately be discharge home sate 99 to 100 % on room air with a good exercise tolerance . 9. infant . their baby boy towery be do very well upon discharge . he be follow by the pediatric service at chardson medical center and be discharge home with them . 10. neuro . initially , her mental status in the medical intensive care unit would wax and wane . she would be intermittently disorient . a head ct be obtain postoperative day # 4 , and this be show to have no focal abnormality although there be some indication that there might have be some strand between the white and gray matter consistent with possible edema . this report be not mention in the final report of the head ct. upon discharge , her mental status be at baseline with perfect memory of the event lead up to the stat cesarean section although she have some difficulty remember specific with regard to her medical intensive care unit admission , and the ensuing day . she be alert and orient to person , place , and time . 11. physical therapy . she undergo a physical therapy consult with the impression of improve physical status and exercise . she be give exercise strategy that she will continue at home . she be offer home physical therapy but decline a she think the visiting vna would be adequate and that she be able to be out of bed with her usual exercise tolerance . disposition : on postoperative day # 11 , status post her stat cesarean section for iufd with twin and postpartum hemorrhage dic , she be discharge home with a plan to follow up in the ob clinic in 4 day with dr. fred riter and dr. shad brondyke she will also be see by dr. durnin of endocrinology . she will have daily vna dress change and be instruct to call if she have any fever , chill , nausea , vomit , increase bleeding from the incision or if she have any question . discharge medication : 1. colace 100 mg p.o . b.i.d . 2. levoxyl 75 mcg p.o . daily . 3. oxycodone 5 to 10 mg p.o . q.4h . p.r.n . pain . 4. senna tablet 2 tab p.o . b.i.d . 5. simethicone 80 mg p.o . q.i.d . 6. labetalol 200 mg p.o . b.i.d . 7. nph 10 unit q.a.m . and q.p.m . 8. humalog slide scale ac 5-10 unit . discharge diagnosis : 1. pregnancy , status post stat cesarean section for iufd , nonreassuring fetal heart trace . 2. vfib arrest . 3. dic . 4. severe pet/hellp . 5. thrombocytopenia . 6. elevate liver enzyme . 7. hypothyroidism . 8. a2 gestational diabetes . ultimately she be discharge home with low platelet . throughout her hospital course , she be appreciate to have evidence of low platelet on her first cbc upon presentation to ardma medical center as well a chest compression , and a pulse be once again obtain . in the triage , she be find to have evidence of a demised twin as well a evidence of a heart rate of the second twin in the 90 's . escription document : 2-5532923 hffocus transcriptionists dictate by : jodha , donnie attending : brett dominic cobbins , m.d . ty98 dictation id 9576305 d : 3/15/05 t : 3/15/05",-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

she be admit with increase dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea and a weight gain over the past week prior to admission . she have most likely have a failure of home diuretic , and need to have her effusion tap along with some definitive therapy for her yellow nail syndrome in term of recurrent pleural effusion . hospital course : 1. pulmonary . we initially diuresed ms. jowell with iv lasix , along with diuril . she have brisk diuresis overnight , but be still short of breath the next day . on hospital day # 2 , we do a thoracentesis on her right side and be able to remove 1.5 liter of clear , yellowish fluid . the fluid be send for cytology , as well a chemistry and return a an exudative effusion with predominant lymphocyte . the cytology be negative for any malignant cell . the pulmonary team be consult , who decide that she would benefit from a pleurodesis to prevent effusion from recur . we consult thoracic surgery , who request a ct scan after a thoracentesis to assess her lung for evidence of malignancy . ct scan be do on 9/19/01 , but due to atelectasis and have to do the study without iv contrast , there be area in her right and leave lung that appear nodular or opacified and could have be malignancy . ct surgery also request cardiac clearance before any definitive surgical therapy be do due to new onset svt . we obtain a stress mibi . on 9/4/01 , she be take to the operating room for surgery of the right chest . at that time , dr. woman , the cardiothoracic surgeon take biopsy of her pleura , which be reportedly thicken and yellow . she also take a wedge biopsy of the right low lobe . those biopsy have return , and reveal mild nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis with chronic bronchiolitis . the diaphragm be also biopsied , and be determine to be lymphoid tissue in a fibrous tissue fragment . she have a chest tube place at the time of operation and tolerate that well . however , after that procedure , she be deem unstable by the pacu team and be admit to micu overnight . she extubated without problem and remain on a few liter of oxygen overnight , with oxygen saturation in the 90 % . she be readmitted to the medicine team on the following day , 8/28/01 . overall , she tolerate that procedure well . her chest tube that be place on the right side do not drain much fluid over the next few day . however , the pleural effusion on the left side , do increase in size and we do a thoracentesis on 8/28/01 . we remove 1 liter of turbid , yellowish brown fluid . the chemistry reveal a lymphocyte and macrophage predominance and the cytology be still pending at this time . a her chest tube be not drain much fluid , the thoracic surgery team decide to pleurodese her with doxycycline , which have show to be effective in yellow nail syndrome in patient 's 70 % of the time . the pleurodesis be on 3/29/01 . she tolerate this procedure well , and have little chest tube drainage over the next 48 hour . the chest tube be pull on 6/2/01 . mrs. musson 's shortness of breath be much improve after the initial thoracentesis on the right , and she be currently on her home oxygen requirement of 2 liter , satting in the mid-90 % . the plan be for her to see dr. colasante in 2 week and also have a follow-up chest x-ray . at that time , dr. ostermann will determine if there be fluid reaccumulating on the right after the pleurodesis . she can then have a repeat pleurodesis on the right , or an initial pleurodesis on the left . 2. cardiovascular . mrs. blan be tachycardic on admission , and continue to be tachycardic throughout the admission . she be initially diuresed with iv lasix and diuril , and be probably over diuresed , a total of 2-3 liter over a number of hour overnight . on hospital day # 2 , she be find to be tachycardic with rate in the 140s-150s and atrial fibrillation . she convert back to normal sinus rhythm with 3 dos of iv calcium channel blocker and a diltiazem drip . she be then maintain on diltiazem sr 60 mg po b.i.d . throughout the admission and remain in normal sinus rhythm . however , her tachycardia be note to be multifocal hl tachycardia during her micu admission . at the time of admission , we do a pulsus which be only 8 mmhg . she have a bedside echocardiogram to rule out a pericardial effusion , which reveal a trace pericardial effusion . she also have a dobutamine mibi for cardiac clearance for the cardiothoracic surgical procedure . her heart rate increase from 107-129 , and the blood pressure decrease from 115/70 - 110/70 at peak stress . the clinical response to dobutamine be non-ischemic , the blood pressure response be normal , and the ekg response to dobutamine be non-ischemic . there be no definite regional perfusion defect see on the stress or rest image . however , only planer image could be obtain , due to difficulty with positioning of the patient 's left arm . her result be determine to be normal , and suggestive of no evidence of hemodynamically secondary cad , although the study be technically limited . in term of her diuresis , ms. duensing be keep on iv lasix for only the first few day of her admission , and then be switch to po diuretic . initially at a dose of 200 mg po b.i.d . , and then decrease to 120 mg po b.i.d . her low extremity edema decrease significantly , along with her pleural effusion . 3. renal . ms. handy 's baseline creatinine be 1.7 , her creatinine throughout her admission vary between 1.6-1.9. we cause a mild contraction alkalosis with diuretic , but be able to replete her electrolyte a need . she will follow with dr. svinth for her renal insufficiency a an outpatient . 4. endocrine . ms. reppell have type ii diabetes and be on glyburide 5 mg q. d. a an outpatient . she continue that therapy a an inpatient

st change . the test be think to show no evidence of ischemia but have a low work load . it be think appropriate to discharge the patient to home for further medical management and further urologic workup a an outpatient . the most important medical intervention would be to keep his hematocrit great than 30 with vigilant monitoring . during this admission , the patient receive a total of six unit of packed red cell . and have a hematocrit of 30.9 on discharge . from a urologic standpoint , the patient be follow by urology during his hospitalization , who felt that his condition be secondary to radiation cystitis . give that he be now have hematuria to the extent of require frequent transfusion , surgery i.e . a urinary diversion with ileal conduit , will most likely be necessary in the near future . he will continue to follow-up with urology a an outpatient . discharge medication : ferrous sulfate 300 mg p.o . q.day , folic acid 1 mg p.o . q.day , glyburide 10 mg

shortness of breath , chill and diaphoresis and so he present to the emergency room . in the emergency room , he have a temperature of 100 degree with room air oxygen saturation between 90 % and 95 % . he be culture and a chest x-ray be take which show a right middle lobe infiltrate and therefore , he be admit with a community acquire pneumonia resistant to outpatient management . past medical history : a above . physical examination : vital sign : temperature 100.1 degree , blood pressure 130/80 , heart rate 60 , oxygen saturation 99 % on three liter nasal cannula . his heent examination be unremarkable . his lung examination reveal rhonchorous breath sound throughout with decreased breath sound at his base , right great than left . he also have diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheeze . his cardiac examination reveal a regular rate and rhythm , s1 and s2 , no murmur , gallop or rub . the abdominal examination be benign . his extremity reveal no edema . his neurological examination be non-focal . laboratory : his laboratory study be notable for a chem-7 that be within normal limit . his cbc reveal a white blood cell count of 7.3 with a hematocrit of 33.5 and a platelet count of 130. his ekg show normal sinus rhythm at 60 with left atrial enlargement . there be no ischemic change . his chest x-ray reveal diffuse infiltrates bilaterally with a more focal area of consolidation in the right middle lobe . hospital course : the patient be a 65 year-old male with diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease and sleep apnea who be admit with a community acquire pneumonia who have fail outpatient management . he be initially start on intravenous cefuroxime and azithromycin for likely community acquire bacterial pathogen and atypical organism . he be culture and sputum be obtain , however no organism be ever isolate throughout his hospital course . on hospital day number two , he develop increase shortness of breath with oxygen saturation of roughly 86 % on six liter . at this time , his lung examination be notable for marked increase in the inspiratory and expiratory wheeze with decreased air movement . the rest of his examination at this time include the cardiac examination be unremarkable . this event be felt to be bronchospasm due to airway inflammation and he be treat with numerous albuterol nebulizer and intravenous lasix on which his oxygenation gradually improve to 96 % on six liter . because of the concern of reactive airway disease and perhaps worsen pneumonia , he be at this time switch to legionella dos of azithromycin and be start on aggressive nebulizer treatment . however , at this time , the possibility of flash pulmonary edema cause cardiac problem be also raise . however , it be note at this time that there be no clear precipitant for an episode of flash pulmonary edema and that his blood pressure be at baseline . his heart rate be at 70 and he have not become obviously fluid overload . nonetheless , he receive a cardiac work-up which conclude that he be be rule out for a myocardial infarction and the following day , he receive an echocardiogram which reveal an ejection fraction of 58 % with apical inferior and inferoseptal akinesis . there be no marked leave ventricular hypertrophy . therefore , it be think unlikely that flash pulmonary edema have significantly contribute to his hypoxia and he be subsequently treat solely for severe community acquire pneumonia with a large bronchospastic component . he be therefore continue on cefuroxime and azithromycin with gradual resolution of his fever and a significant improvement in his air movement and his pulmonary examination . two week prior to this admission , he be start on a prednisone taper and subsequent underwent mark improvement in his air movement and in the degree of bronchospasm . therefore , he be discharge home on the following medication . medication on discharge : 1 ) biaxin 500 mg p.o . b.i.d . time two day to complete a long course for atypical coverage . 2 ) albuterol inhaler 2 puff q.i.d . p.r.n . shortness of breath . 3 ) enteric coat aspirin . 4 ) glyburide 5 mg p.o . q. day . 5 ) lopressor 50 mg p.o . b.i.d . 6

with his primary care provider . we have also ask him to follow-up on two laboratory abnormality which come back through his hospitalization and he be note to have a microcytic anemia and he have iron study send which reveal an iron of 16 and a tibc of 241. his primary care provider be aware of this and will follow-up on this a an outpatient . disposition : the patient be discharge to home .
