of coronary artery disease and multiple risk factor concern for acute coronary syndrome the patient be initially treat for a possible ischemic event diagnosis of pe result be consider however the patient be not tachycardic she do not have any chest pain or new requirement and have have several workups for pulmonary embolism during prior hospitalization with similar system so therefore this be think to be less likely hospital course by system cardiac in term of ischemia the patient have test of cardiac enzyme which return negative she be maintain on telemetry and she have ekg check which do not reveal any change this be a patient who have a dobutamine mibi which be negative for any evidence of ischemic change during the mibi there be no evidence of ischemia scar the patient be continue on her outpatient medication include aspirin zocor and atenolol however at a late point in her hospitalization she become hypotensive at which time her atenolol be temporarily dc but this be restart prior to discharge in term of the patient cardiac function she have a history of chf and be on lasix a an outpatient an echocardiogram be repeat during this hospitalization which be notable for an ef of mr moderate tr and estimate pulmonary systolic pressure at mmhg the patient be continue on outpatient lasix regimen until at a late point during this hospitalization the patient become hypertensive with acute renal failure at which time her lasix be discontinue lasix be restart prior to discharge in term of the patient rhythm she have no evidence of arrhythmia monitor throughout her hospitalization gi on the patient develop acute onset of diarrhea and low abdominal pain now this pain be nonradiating alternate sharp and dull but constant associate with nausea and vomiting and frequent stool at time the stool be notable for bright red blood the patient be therefore start on levofloxacin and flagyl a treatment for diverticulitis versus ischemic colitis to further evaluate this a ct scan of the abdomen be do which be notable for a thickened colon for cm at the hepatic flexure give this information it be the gi consult opinion that this be most likely consistent with diverticulitis and the plan be to treat it aggressively with antibiotic and once the symptom resolve recommend a colonoscopy several week after discharge the patient be continue on levofloxacin and flagyl but then several day later become hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the at this time the patient antibiotic coverage be change to include ceptaz and vancomycin and she also receive dose of gentamicin by the time of discharge the patient abdominal symptom have completely resolve she be no longer have any abdominal pain and she need no longer have any diarrhea and be tolerate a regular diet without any difficulty the plan be for her to have a followup colonoscopy a an outpatient pulmonary the patient be admit for shortness of breath a differential diagnosis at that time include chronic pulmonary embolism versus cardiac etiology versus deconditioning in the setting of a chronic pulmonary fibrosis to establish that the patient do not have any pe she have low extremity doppler exam which be negative she also have a pt protocol ct which be negative for any evidence of clot because the patient do have cardiopulmonary hypertension she be start on coumadin a prophylaxis for any thrombosis in the setting of her low flow in her pulmonary vasculature throughout this hospitalization she be continue on her own home regimen of renal the patient have baseline chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine at during this hospitalization at a time that her diarrhea be very severe and when her blood pressure fell in the the patient develop acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of with decreased urine output the thought of the team be that this represent a renal failure in the setting of her diarrhea fluid loss and hypertension her pheno be consistent with this at she be treat with aggressive iv fluid she also have a renal ultrasound which be normal she do have day of hematuria which be think to be due most likely to foley trauma which resolve at the time of discharge id the patient hospital course be notable for a diarrhea a mention in gi she be initially treat with levofloxacin and flagyl and then when she become hypertensive be then change her flagyl ceptaz and vancomycin with dose of gentamicin her symptom dramatically improve on these antibiotic on she be change from iv antibiotic to a regimen of flagyl and levofloxacin the plan be for

the valve area be there be mild mitral regurgitation there be trace tricuspid regurgitation with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of mm plus right atrial pressure hospital course by problem cardiovascular ischemia the patient be admit because they have deep t wave inversion in the lateral lead and be still concern for anginal equivalence of nausea and vomit it be decide on admission that an echocardiogram would be perform and if there be evidence of any regional wall motion abnormality that she would be take directly to cath the echocardiogram a note above show inferior hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery disease she be take to the cath lab on and they show two that one of the bypass graft be completely occluded and be not visualize they also saw that there be a proximal rca lesion which be find to account for the inferior hypokinesis give the right arm circulation this be stented with a taxus stent because of her kidney insufficiency it be decide not to pursue the left circ lesion and this be defer until later point a this be not think to be cause any problem her post cath ecg be unchanged and continue to have the deep lateral t wave inversion she do not complain of any chest pain or nausea and vomiting during her admission she be start on aspirin and plavix initially although as note below she do have an apparent allergy to plavix and thus be switch to ticlopidine mg instead of plavix for anticoagulation she be also continued lipitor mg daily lopressor mg after her cath it be originally plan that she would go back to cath for intervention on the left circulation lesion however give her other medical problem and her relative stability hemodynamically and symptomatically it be decide that they would wait and decide later if this lesion need to be correct in the future or not pump the patient have no significant issue with her blood pressure here she remain in a blood pressure range of throughout her stay she be continue on her beta blocker a note above however at discharge this be switch back to atenolol a her home medication and she refuse to change medication she say that she would not be able to afford new prescription we do increase her dose of atenolol to mg from mg daily a her requirement of beta blockade seem to be high than what her home dose be give that she have a concurrent renal disease it would probably be useful for her to be on an ace inhibitor arb as well this medication should be add a an outpatient if her blood pressure tolerate it it be on the low side here so we do not add it we do not diurese her in fact we hold her lasix on admission because she seem to be volume deplete give that she be admit with a lot of diarrhea this again will need to be reconsider if she have increase edema this can be restart c rhythm the patient be keep on telemetry however there be no significant episode of arrhythmia during her admission gi the patient be admit with persistent nausea and diarrhea from tlmamuthes medical center the diarrhea resolve one day after admission her fecal leukocyte be positive but her diff be negative it be unclear what the etiology of this diarrhea be and we be go to send a repeat stool study however she do not have any diarrhea afterwards and this may be antibiotic associated diarrhea but it seem to resolve spontaneously pulmonary the patient be admit with crackle in the left low lobe and some wheezing consistent with copd and pneumonia a chest on admission show a right low lobe we initially continue her on augmentin which she be take for her diabetic foot ulcer however she do not appear to clinically respond to this medication we hold her antibiotic a noted below in the id section and after that her white blood cell count increase and she produce some purulent sputum and rods the rod be later speciate a serratia although this information be not available at the time of her discharge she be treat for a pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftazidime to complete a course clinically she appear to improve on this regimen although her white count be still elevate at on discharge however give her overall clinical stability the lack of fever and the lack of systemic symptom we felt comfortable with discharge her with close follow up infectious disease the patient be initially admit on augmentin for a diabetic foot ulcer the note from grantnas healthcare by the infectious disease service recommend a week course of augmentin for her diabetic foot ulcer she have complete three week of therapy and thus we discontinue this medication a it do not seem that there be really any evidence of active infection in her foot after hold the antibiotic for three day her white count begin to rise and she develop a purulent cough a note above this be think to be a pneumonia she be treat with vancomycin and ceftazidime and she will complete a course of these antibiotic endocrine the patient be home on oral hypoglycemics she be switch to coverage with an insulin scale her sugar be relatively well control and she do not require much in the way of supplemental insulin renal the patient have chronic kidney disease her baseline creatinine be she be admit and have a cath she be give mucomyst and bicarbonated fluid for renal protection during her dilute because of the risk for kidney the cath be do with a little amount of dye a possible her creatinine remain stable throughout her admission and settle out at of her creatinine which be the baseline allergy during the patient admission it be note that she develop a rash on she be see by the allergy and immunology service at the request of the cath lab give that there be concern that she have this rash because of her plavix they felt that this be possible this be the most likely etiology and in conjunction with her high eosinophil count it be felt that this be a drug reaction to the plavix she be switch to ticlopidine mg and her rash appear to improve she be also give claritin as well a put on a brief prednisone taper give her diffuse rash and her brisk eosinophilia she should follow up with allergy and immunology in about one month to see if the rash have resolve and potentially to try rechallenge with plavix at that point foot ulcer the patient have have a longstanding diabetic foot ulcer which have be treat by wound care vna and be treat at tha hospital we continue the augmentin to a total course of three week and then stop it we continue her dress change and this will be follow by the vna at home there be no evidence of active infection there be no purulence or erythema around the area of the ulcer and the erythema around the foot appear to be stable this be most likely chronic venous stasis change and not a true cellulitis a there be no warmth or tenderness in this

the patient have an leave circumflex lesion which be not stented this should be whether she need a second intervention in the future she do appear to be asymptomatic but she do continue to have the deep lateral t wave inversion suggest the area of abnormal blood flow in the heart it be think that the right rca lesion be more likely to be the cause of her inferior wall hypokinesis so that be the procedure perform the patient be treat for pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftazidime this will continue until she be note to have a rash here which be think to be plavix relate if the rash resolve on ticlopidine she may need to readdress whether or not this be actually due to plavix it be recommend that she follow up with an allergist in about a month from her hospitalization who can review the record and determine whether she should start plavix or maintain on the ticlopidine her platelet should be monitor give that she start on ticlopidine and there be a risk of ttp associate with this

preservation of the speech processing ability with dense motor and sensory involvement this be felt to potentially represent an mca branch occlusion with increased edema versus a large lacuna in addition give her history the team be unable to rule out the possibility of an embolic event therefore the patient be admit and rule out for a myocardial infarction her cks be and she be place on a cardiac monitor with no evidence of arrhythmia she be place on subcu heparin and start on full dose aspirin milligram in order to far work up the etiology for stroke the patient have an echocardiogram do which reveal evidence of concentric lvh with preserved systolic function calculate ejection fraction of other than nonspecific septal abnormality there be no evidence of regional wall motion dysfunction there be early change of mitral annular calcification present some increased excursion of the mitral leaflet but this be associate with only trivial regurgitation trileaflet aortic valve

addition the patient primary rheumatologist be consult as well the patient primary rheumatologist felt that the patient stroke be most likely due to small vessel disease associate with diabetes and hypertension he felt there be no evidence for a vasculitis he therefore suggest to continue aspirin but in high dos to alleviate her left shoulder pain the patient do not feel that she have any vasculitic process they therefore recommend continue aspirin milligram check a serum homocystine which remain pending at the time of this dictation review her carotid study mention above and continue with physical therapy occupational therapy and speech therapy pt and ot be consult as well a speech therapy in addition to continue the patient on aspirin continue subcu heparin while the patient be

study be unremarkable rheumatologic a note the patient have a long history of diffuse arthritic complaint she have her sed rate and protein check rheumatology be consult who felt that her stroke be not consistent with a vascular process they do recommend check a urinalysis to check for red blood cell and cast her urinalysis show no protein no blood red blood cell no cast only other recommendation be to continue aspirin and consider high dos to alleviate left shoulder pain in addition recommend avoid nonsteroidal while the patient be on aspirin endocrine the patient have a history of diabetes mellitus and have not take her insulin for several day prior to admission the patient be place on her regular insulin schedule as well a a slide scale the patient blood sugar have

evidence of metastatic disease on over the past few month the patient have have chronic problem with nausea and decrease appetite this have become especially acute over the past week and a a result her chemotherapy be now on hold she have also have some worsen diarrhea for which she be prescribed imodium but because of ongoing issue with compliance it be felt that she be not take enough at home during an outpatient visit with her cardiologist her blood pressure be note to be so her dose of atenolol and lasix be decrease of note the patient be status post a recent admission to mh for digoxin toxicity so this medication be now also on hold of note the patient be not currently on coumadin despite a history of atrial fibrillation due to a history of gi bleed possible interaction with her

drainage stool study be send include difficile ovum and parasites cecal leukocyte and study all of which be negative because of the concern nature of the symptom surgery consult be call however they felt that her problem be likely nonsurgical in nature ct perform two day and five day after admission show identical finding of colitis they remain largely unchanged nevertheless the patient experience continued nausea and vomiting and also continue diarrhea throughout this time once her nasogastric tube output decrease significantly approximately one week after admission the tube be remove and the patient be start on and her diet be advance a tolerate from that point on the patient have no nausea or vomiting and she be currently tolerate a full diet nevertheless she continue to have mild diarrhea now two episode per day a compare to episode per day prior to admission in the end the workup for the underlying cause of her nausea vomiting and diarrhea have be negative it be therefore our suspicion that her symptom be most likely secondary to toxicity from her chemotherapy medication xeloda of note the patient also have other sign of xeloda toxicity include possible hepatotoxicity see below as well a severe cracking and drying of the skin on her hand and foot hepatitis a ct perform on admission to evaluate for small bowel obstruction show a significantly cirrhotic and fatty liver with no mass on admission the patient total bilirubin be however her bilirubin level escalate precipitously to a maximum of at the same time the patient develop clinical manifestation of this include scleral icterus and jaundice also a her albumin level decrease to below she develop significant ascites and peripheral edema gastroenterology consult suggest a right upper quadrant ultrasound which be negative for obstruction a hepatic mri which also show a cirrhotic and fatty liver and also a ir guide paracentesis which drain liter of sterile fluid hepatitis serology be also send and the patient be hepatitis a and b negative but c positive however her viral load be less than assay and her afp be within normal limit a rheumatologic workup for autoimmune hepatitis be also negative because of the acuteness and the timing of her presentation it be felt that her liver failure be likely secondary to a combination of hepatitis and also toxicity from her xeloda on discharge the patient hepatic function have be improve significantly for three day with her albumin increase her inr decreasing and her bilirubin level also decrease on discharge her total bilirubin be down from her albumin be up from and her inr be down from it be anticipate that a the patient nutritional status continue to improve her hepatic function will continue to normalize with result normalization of her laboratory value cardiovascular on admission the patient be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at the rate of approximately beat per minute she be also hypotensive with a blood pressure of roughly she be place on cardiac telemetry which record rapid fib up to the a a result she be give iv lopressor with decreased heart rate but also significant reduction in her blood pressure require fluid bolus after hour after her blood pressure have stabilize follow the administration of intravenous fluid she be start on a diltiazem drip at mg per hour which help to establish stable rate control in the with continued atrial fibrillation at the same time the patient be load with digoxin but her level be high give that the patient be status post a recent admission for digoxin toxicity this medication be subsequently hold in one incident the patient develop a temporary junctional rhythm for approximately minute with a heart rate in the at that point input be elicit from the cardiology consult service who think that her symptom be likely secondary to the diltiazem drip however give concern for a syndrome the possibility of an implantable cardiac pacemaker be discuss however the patient do not have any recurrence of the junctional rhythm a tte be obtain which show an ejection fraction of with trace mr and moderate tr leave and right atrial enlargement and normal left and right ventricular function once the patient be again take medication her diltiazem drip be change to diltiazem for the next several day the patient have several episode each night of to beat run of nsvt however on the three day prior to discharge the patient have no event on telemetry and her heart rate be stable in the to with a blood pressure run from shortly before discharge the patient also develop episodic shortness of breath which be attribute to mild pulmonary edema and she respond well to bolus of iv lasix a a result she be restart on aldactone with effective gentle diuresis the plan on discharge will be to follow her volume status carefully and to adjust her diuretic regimen a need to maintain her volume status with continued improvement in her hepatic function endocrine the patient have a history of diabetes mellitus and her metformin be hold on admission secondary to an elevated creatinine a a result she be start on a lispro slide scale give that she be for several day she be not give any insulin and her blood sugar remain stable in the low after she again start take she be restart on a slide scale and she maintain excellent blood sugar control between and a hemoglobin obtain during this admission be also within normal limit of note the patient have a leave toe ulcer and be see by orthopedic surgery and outpatient totally before admission heme the patient have an inr of on admission secondary to cirrhosis and poor nutrition a a result she be give vitamin k subcu as need a note above despite a history of atrial fibrillation the patient be not on coumadin at home secondary to poor med compliance at home she be only on aspirin but this be also discontinue during the admission secondary to continue guaiac positive stool nevertheless her hematocrit remain stable throughout her admission and she do not require any transfusion a dvt prophylaxis the patient be keep on pneumo boot throughout the admission at one point she be note to have leave upper extremity swell great than the right upper extremity but an ultrasound be negative for dvt a note above on discharge the patient inr be improve secondary to improve nutrition she will be discharge without any anticoagulation at present however this can be far reevaluate a an outpatient by her cardiologist and oncologist fen the patient be initially rehydrated with normal saline however this be change to plus amp of bicarb since she develop a bicarb gap once this gap be close she be give gentle normal saline a maintenance fluid once the patient start take significant her iv fluid be discontinue the patient electrolyte be also replete a necessary plan on discharge will be to continue follow her electrolyte closely to prevent further exacerbation of her cardiac arrhythmia pain the patient be give oxycodone and morphine iv for pain the patient be previously on vioxx at home for orthopedic pain related to her diabetes however give recent data suggest possible cardiotoxic effect of vioxx this will be discontinue and she will be send home with oxycodone for pain onc the patient xeloda be currently on hold since many of her symptom lead up to this admission be likely secondary to chemo toxicity a note above the patient have other evidence of chemo toxicity as well include significantly dry skin on her hand and foot the patient outpatient oncologist willard brixius follow her closely during this admission and she will follow up with the patient regard possible change to her chemotherapy regimen disposition the patient be see by the physical therapy service shortly before discharge and they note that she display difficulty even move from the bed to the chair which be significantly below her baseline of be able to ambulate independently a a result after extensive discussion with her family it be decide that the patient will be best serve by go to a rehab facility for continue closed supervision of her medical problem supervise administration of her medication regimen continue strength training and conditioning and also continue nutrition once the patient be able to be less dependent on outside

the patient do not demonstrate this rhythm consistently however during her hypertensive episode on review of the patient past medical history however it be find that the patient have be on chronic steroid for two year prior to her cabg and prior to the onset of these symptom of orthostasis and dizziness patient note that she be more on than off on steroid for treatment of her shortness of breath at an outside hospital in perv rome voraso nevada at that time they have deem that her shortness of breath symptom be secondary to pulmonary etiology rather than cardiac we therefore suspect adrenal insufficiency and consult endocrine acth stem test be perform and cortisol adolsterone and acth level be draw at and minute of acth the patient develop hive and angioedema with the acth which be relieve with benadryl iv after the performance of the acth stem test empirically start on hydrocortisone mg iv the next day the patient symptom resolve and she no longer have any evidence of orthostatic hypertension or dizziness symptom relate to stand or walk repeat blood pressure measurement for orthostatic be unyielding the patient note her symptom be completely resolve and that she felt like a different person it be therefore felt that the empiric trial of hydrocortisone be significant and that the patient most likely have adrenal insufficiency secondary to chronic steroid for the two year prior to the cabg and this be consistent with the time closer to patient symptom which begin after the cabg when she be off steroids the patient be therefore discharge in stable condition with diagnosis of a left pleural effusion secondary to most likely a syndrome as well a orthostatic hypertension and dizziness symptom secondary to adrenal insufficiency at the time of discharge the patient acth stem test be still pending as well a the tsh it be felt at the time of discharge the patient should not be manage on captopril or digoxin it remain unclear whether or not the patient

likely due to volume overload with resultant right heart failure ascites have white blood cell with polys therefore it be not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ascitic fluid be negative for growth of bacteria and cytology of the ascitic fluid identify no malignant cell after consultation with the cardiology service it be conclude that the ascites be due to massive volume overload and therefore the patient should undergo reduction of volume through ultrafiltration at dialysis this process be begin a an inpatient by the renal service while the patient be an inpatient effort to remove fluid be complicate by development of hypotension during dialysis as well a by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with heart rate up to the due to the difficulty with remove fluid at dialysis the patient be offer the option of undergo ultrafiltration by cvvh or an ultrafiltration machine but the patient and the family decline to participate in such care it should also be note that despite our effort the patient be not compliant with fluid restriction that be put into place in the patient diet order therefore also make it difficult to treat the patient volume overload the patient be discharge with the plan to continue ultrafiltration at outpatient dialysis in an attempt to continue to remove fluid and reduce the patient volume overload this plan be communicate by the attend renal simon esbrandt to the patient outpatient renal attend archie chhum renal a describe above the patient have renal disease on hemodialysis a describe above ultrafiltration be attempt at hemodialysis to remove as much fluid a possible and to reduce the patient volume overload state ultrafiltration should be continue a an outpatient to continue to attempt

prior to his undergoing surgical revision of his right leg therefore aspirin and plavix be restart on pump the patient have evidence of right heart failure by echocardiogram on physical exam and a describe above this be likely a consequence of the volume overload again a describe above volume be remove through ultrafiltration at dialysis rhythm the patient have a history of atrial fibrillation

severely decreased cardiac output organ perfusion she be start on the lasix drip at mg per hour and zaroxolyn at mg daily her lopressor be hold for a decompensated heart failure she initially diuresed well overnight however on the second day her diuresis taper off and her lasix drip be turn up to mg per hour and the zaroxolyn be increase to she meet her i o goal of great than liter negative overnight the follow night however a day later she again have poor diuresis and the zaroxolyn be change to diuril at this time a repeat chest show a very little change in her bilateral pleural

to however remain stable for the next few day and the patient be able to maintain good diuresis on this regimen without bump in her creatinine on she be note to have greatly improve low extremity

anticipated discharge home on the diuril be also discontinue the patient be anticipate to be stable on torsemide and on metolazone at home her new dry weight on this admission be establish at kilogram and this should be at a goal for diuresis should she require admission in the future she will follow up with her csh cardiologist for further monitoring of her volume status after discharge in term of rhythm the patient have a new presentation of atrial fibrillation on the prior admission and be start on amiodarone and coumadin at that time she be in normal sinus rhythm on presentation at this admission and remain in normal sinus rhythm throughout the admission and be monitor on telemetry with no other event she be continue on her home dose of amiodarone and continue on coumadin however despite the dose be decrease from her home dose of mg to a mg her inr continue to rise and be eventually her coumadin be discontinue she be recommend to be discharge off coumadin and follow up with

renal clinic with whom she have have a previous conversation about the possibility of hemodialysis in the future and she will see them shortly after this discharge pulmonary the patient have dyspnea on exertion and bilateral pleural effusion on her chest on admission this be all felt to be consistent with her heart failure she do have no sign or symptom of any infectious etiology either on imaging or a a part of her clinical picture her dyspnea on exertion and her lung exam both improved with her aggressive diuresis endocrine the patient have erratic fingersticks early in the admission with a very low fingerstick blood glucose in the morning initially so her lantus dose be decrease from unit to unit and the novolog slide scale be start on she be note to continue to have low sugar in the morning but routinely elevated sugar in the afternoon great than she be start on novolog regimen however on this regimen she be find morning to have a fingerstick blood glucose of and to be hypothermic with a temperature of take rectally this be think to be secondary to hypoglycemia which may have progress over several hour prior to assessment and her temperature return to normal at after her blood glucose be aggressively replete it be felt that the patient likely have decrease metabolism of her injected insulin in the setting of worsen renal failure so her lantus be decrease in accordance with a curbside consultation with the diabetes management service she will be discharge home on a similar regimen to her home regimen simply with a decreased lantus dose down to unit nightly she should continue to monitor her fingerstick blood glucose at home we be hesitant to change the type or timing of her insulin during this hospitalization i leave that item to be far manage

neurologic examination the patient be alert and orient time three cranial nerve be intact the patient do not have any sensation in bilateral leg normal strength laboratory data significant for hematocrit of white blood count with a differential of polys band lymphocytes be significant for creatinine of her liver function test be within normal range her ck first set be with an mb of and troponin of coags normal of great than her urinalysis be negative electrocardiogram show mm st depression in the lateral lead unchanged from baseline chest reveal bilateral interstitial prominence could be consistent with pulmonary edema no focal opacity hospital course problem cellulitis on admission the patient be start on cefazolin and flagyl for broad coverage of cellulitis give she have a history of diabetes mellitus in addition levofloxacin be also start on hospital day to cover gram negative organism blood culture on admission be negative because of the skin graft on the patient right heel plastic surgery be consult to assess the integrity of the skin graft they conclude that the skin graft be intact and the source of the cellulitis be not in the heel on hospital day flagyl be discontinue because the patient could not tolerate oral sore and the gi upset therefore we elect to change the antibiotic regimen to clindamycin and levofloxacin cefazolin and flagyl be discontinue on hospital day the patient develop diarrhea give her history of difficile in the past and the lack of improvement in her cellulitis infectious disease be consult we start cefotaxime and vancomycin on hospital day the patient continue to have low grade temperature spike with daily blood culture which have all be negative wound culture of the bulla on the right low extremity be also take which have also be negative vancomycin be discontinue due to low suspicion of resistant organism the patient also have lenis which be negative for dvt as well a a right foot film which show no sign of osteomyelitis unfortunately the cellulitis do not look significantly improve we postulate that this be due to a combination of noncompliance with strict elevation peripheral edema from congestive heart failure peripheral vascular disease and diabetes the patient continue to spike low grade temperature we carry out pan culture which have all be negative so far include urine blood at the time of this dictation the patient have be on cefotaxime for seven day infectious disease recommend an mri to rule out osteo and deep infection since the cellulitis be very slowly improve problem chronic renal failure and chronic renal insufficiency on admission we start to diurese the patient a she be volume overload by examination in addition we start her on her outpatient blood pressure medication to control her hypertension however on hospital day the patient blood pressure dip into the high to with a rise in creatinine we withhold all blood pressure medication as well a diuresis her creatinine continue to climb from to the urinalysis show numerous red blood cell and no eosinophil of note her urine culture grow out lactobacillus which be not treated renal be consult and it be think that the patient acute renal failure be due to prerenal cause from a drop in blood pressure as well a mild atn the patient creatinine respond to gentle fluid bolus and resolve on it own by hospital day during the period of acute renal failure the patient also have mark hyponatremia which also resolve a the renal function improve the creatinine improve to on hospital day at this time she undergo a ct with contrast to delineate a possible liver mass her subsequent creatinine climb to we have also start her on her outpatient dose of enalapril and lasix we elect to discontinue the enalapril and lasix due to her increased creatinine we will observe and add back an ace inhibitor a tolerate problem coronary artery disease status post non myocardial infarction the patient be admit on a rule out protocol on her third set of enzyme she show a ck of ck mb of but a troponin of the patient be asymptomatic with no chest pain and no electrocardiogram change cardiology be consult and it be felt that the patient have a small non myocardial infarction with a troponin leak a repeat echo on this admission show preserved ef at with no observable wall motion abnormality a the patient have refuse catheterization in the past it be decide that she be manage medically she be start on metoprolol mg as well a aspirin the patient have remain symptom free problem hypertension the patient be initially slightly hypotensive at a systolic blood pressure of to on hospital day her enalapril and outpatient dose of atenolol be hold she be start back on metoprolol after the non myocardial infarction currently her blood pressure be maintain between systolic we attempt to add back enalapril at this time to preserve her kidney function give her diabetes however her creatinine increase mildly thus we have elect to hold enalapril again problem gastrointestinal the patient have a history of chronic constipation on home regimen of dulcolax senna colace and lactulose a kub be obtain on admission which show air in the colon but no obstruction it be think that her chronic distention be from diabetic gastroparesis and relative immobility the patient develop diarrhea during her hospital course for which her laxative be hold her stool have be difficile negative she have tolerate very little food due to abdominal distention she have continue to advance her diet currently to some small snack during the day her laxative be because the patient continue to spike a low grade temperature and she have some abnormal liver function test we pursue a renal ultrasound to rule out her renal abscess which be negative as well a a right upper quadrant ultrasound the right upper quadrant ultrasound show a possible liver mass for which we order a followup ct of the abdomen the ct of the abdomen show normal variant of the shape of the liver cause by a bowel loop that be anterior to the liver this be unchanged compare to a study that she have in problem anemia on admission the patient be slightly anemic with a hematocrit of during her past hospitalization the patient always have a hematocrit around on this admission her stool be trace guaiac positive she receive two unit of packed red blood cell transfusion with an appropriate response to a hematocrit of gi be consult however since the patient be stable with no further decrease in the hematocrit it be decide that the patient would pursue an outpatient workup of her anemia in term of colonoscopy problem vascular the patient have a history of peripheral vascular disease on admission the vascular surgery service be consult to help manage refractory cellulitis abis be obtain of the right leg which show to on the right low extremity and normal on the left low extremity which have be previously bypass pulse volume record reveal mildly decreased signal in both the right and leave leg the conclusion be that the patient have right femoral popliteal disease with normal rest pressure on the left however a the patient be not very mobile she do not complain of any claudication symptom it be decide that no surgery be indicate for her at this time we use heparin subcutaneous injection a her dvt prophylaxis during her hospitalization problem congestive heart failure the patient have congestive heart failure from diastolic dysfunction on examination she have edema throughout her body include her upper limb in the chest area however attempt at diuresis be abort due to acute renal failure she continue to diurese on her own without any pharmacologic intervention a her creatinine improve at this time her lasix be hold because of a small bump in creatinine from likely the contrast in ct as well a in the enalapril overall she be total body volume up however much improve from admission problem type ii diabetes mellitus the patient blood sugar be poorly control during the hospitalization with finger stick in the high to low this be partially due to the patient reluctance to take her full dose of nph insulin because she be inconsistent with eat she also have a slide scale to cover her we will encourage her to continue with her full dose of insulin a she tolerate food well problem peripheral neuropathy and low back pain the patient neurontin dose be reduce to mg from her outpatient dose of mg due to renal insufficiency she also receive diazepam currently at mg reduce from her outpatient dose of mg

postoperative course be significant for contrast induced oliguric acute renal failure a renal consult be obtain on and the patient be see by studdard to evaluate her acute on chronic renal failure cowlin that her acute renal failure may be due to chronic kidney disease from renovascular disease or possibly due to interstitial nephritis in the setting of a drug allergy the patient be also see by shope erik garret manuel from the nephrology department while she be an inpatient after consideration of possibility cause her acute renal failure it be think that her acute renal failure be most likely due to cholesterol emboli syndrome give her eosinophilia stepwise progression of renal impairment and her chronic course the patient will need to be follow by a nephrologist a an outpatient in addition the patient have know renal artery stenosis that may have contribute to her acute renal failure and she do have a possible drug allergy to diuril and perhaps a component of her renal failure be also due to acute interstitial nephritis on the patient develop gross hematuria at this time the urinalysis show red blood cell but no evidence for atn this gross hematuria be in the setting of a

failure who present with mild volume overload and abdominal pain with nausea and vomit brief hospital course by system cardiovascular ischemia when the patient be admit she be rule out for an mi she do have a slight increase of her troponins which be attribute to mild demand ischemia in addition she have some slight anemia which could also be contribute to the demand as well in addition to the clear volume overload she do fine from the standpoint have no st change on any of her ekg the patient lay her head workup for future avr and mvr with the surgical service with bio her workup be extensive and include a cardiac catheterization which show no significant coronary artery disease the hemodynamics be notable for the following ra of pa of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of with v

report there be gas see within the loop of small bowel as well a the colon there be no bowel dilatation see the overall impression be no evidence of any bowel obstruction it be likely that some of her pain be secondary to hepatic congestion the nausea and vomit eventually resolve and perhaps this be some type of viral illness or gastroenteritis she do have some episode of diarrhea prior to admission along with some abdominal cramp the patient be continue on her ppi for gerd prophylaxis at one point she require increase her dosage of nexium secondary to symptoms it seem that increase the

addition she be give prescription for colace and also senokot today she should continue use heme her hematocrit remain relatively stable during her stay with averaging of to as far a her hematocrit we be not concern with keep her hematocrit or above at all time give her clean coronary artery see from the left and also right heart catheterization she do have a slight dip in her hematocrit at one point require two unit of packed red blood cell her hematocrit bump appropriately to or she require no subsequent transfusion thereafter with regard to anticoagulation she be place on the heparin drip at unit per hour to maintain a ptt between and secondary to her mechanical valve that be in place on discharge the patient be transition to lovenox mg with a renal dosing she will continue to take this lovenox a an outpatient and stop it one to two day prior to her surgery a instruct she have home vna in place renal her bun and creatinine be relatively stable on admission it do elevate to as high a on her admission secondary to her ongoing diuresis when diuresis be hold for several day give her markedly increased urine output and a she become more hydrated and euvolemic her creatinine return to it baseline of she have no active issue now endocrine we appreciate the diabetes service for follow her very closely while several modification be make to her regimen while here to get good

entire admission on september the patient be note to have an increase in her white blood cell count upwards towards the this be one day prior to a plan surgery on april with villata to repair her aortic valve and also her mitral valve the surgery be delay a a result of this so an infectious workup could ensue she have a urine sent that show the suggestion of a urinary tract infection levaquin be give for treatment of her uti surveillance culture be draw daily give the fact that she have a right groin hematoma that perform after the heart catheterization we question whether or not this could be some type of infectious source she have the hematoma aspirate it be negative for any organisms she have no other identified place as far a source of infection it be believe that she could potential have endocarditis a she have have in the past one of her culture actually grow out a specie of abiotrophia there be only one culture positive that be take on february she have have no subsequent culture grow out at the time of this dictation we appreciate the infectious disease team follow their recommendation be to hold antibiotic unless subsequent culture begin to grow out their recommendation be to continue to follow all culture and to perform a tee a repeat tee be perform and show no evidence of any lesion or change in bowel function there be clearly no vegetation see on either any transthoracic echo or tee id make recommendation as far a perioperative antibiotic which would include two week of ceftriaxone g iv under the assumption that this would be complete a course of her therapy after sbe they would also recommend send all valve tissue for gram stain and culture as well a pathology if the gram stain and culture be positive they would suggest extend the course of the antibiotic therapy neurologic the patient be give darvon and also codeine a need for her pain she complain of right groin pain secondary to the hematoma her pain be much improve that she be able to ambulate easily around the tl brown vo on discharge the hematoma be resolve and her pain be resolve as well fluids electrolyte and nutrition the patient be tolerate well her electrolyte be replete a needed daily psychologic the patient be see by social work it be clear that she have many anxiety about the surgery and also in go home and return to her social environment she necessitate volume prior to many procedure give her severe anxiety disposition the patient be stable from a medical standpoint with all culture clear and no evidence of active infection her white blood cell count

of her ranged from the mid to without a very clear correlation between her mental status and her the thought be that her baseline be probably somewhere in the give that her ph be normal with around in the low it be think that she be a chronic carbon dioxide retainer her bicarbonate on admission here previously have be in the mid to high and low just a they be during this admission and that she just have an acute hypercarbic event throughout her stay she have have episode where she become slightly less responsive always will awake with appropriate physical stimulus and will give appropriate

albuterol and atrovent nebulizer and she be start on an inhaled corticosteroid vascular the possibility of a pulmonary embolus be consider especially give her history of pulmonary embolus in the past unfortunately diagnostic imaging be inadequate give her girth and low extremity issue there be discussion of put her on chronic anticoagulation for the possibility of pulmonary embolus however we felt she have a low to moderate probability of pulmonary embolus and that the risk of anticoagulation outweigh the benefit give that she probably do not have a pulmonary embolus or deep venous thrombosis this be discuss with the patient and she agree with that decision this can be readdressed in the future the decision be also center around the fact that her previous pulmonary embolus be in the setting of pelvic surgery and likely do not reflex any increased likelihood of thrombosis however she should be continue on subcutaneous enoxaparin or other prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis while she be bedbound cardiac the patient have a history of hypertension and leave ventricular hypertrophy she should be continue on aspirin mg a day lisinopril mg a day and she will discharge on

of sulfonylurea it may be consider that she will be good candidate for metformin give her weight and likely poor control of her diabetes obstructive sleep apnea with know elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure at approximately right atrium and echocardiogram during her last admission at mertaymonpeters medical center the patient should be counsel and encourage to use her bipap or cpap

no left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage she have mm in and avf with inversion in those lead also inversion with mm st depression in and the only change from the january ekg be that of inversion in otherwise stable impression at the time of admission the patient be think to be a woman with severe copd and chf who present with worsen shortness of breath consistent with a copd excerebration however this be unlike many of her previous exacerbation in that she do not experience any upper respiratory tract infection and in addition her jugular venous pressure be elevate so it be consider that she might be have a congestive heart failure exacerbation a well pulmonary the patient be treat for copd exacerbation with prednisone mg by mouth each morning atrovent and albuterol nebulizer and albuterol and atrovent nebulizer a need she be also continue on levofloxacin initially the patient receive mg of levofloxacin a day a her renal function worsen that be change to mg a day and when her renal function improve again her levofloxacin be once again increase to mg a day this should be continue for a course there be little concern for pulmonary embolism give the patient elevate inr however she do have a decrease saturation and her be not very elevate at the outside hospital a be send which be less than which be negative suggestive very highly for a pulmonary embolism the patient pulmonary status improve throughout her stay and by may she be sate in the range on liter nasal cannula almost at baseline it be think by the physical therapy that the patient would benefit from further pulmonary rehabilitation a this dictation be be do the plan be for her either to go to pulmonary rehabilitation or to stay at the hospital until she be fully ready and safe to go home and be not at an increased fall risk give her severe osteoporosis cardiovascular pump initially the patient be think to possibly be volume overload give the fact that she be not take her lasix and that her jvp appear elevate in addition there be some question whether she might have be have increase paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or at least orthopnea she be initially diuresed aggressively with mg of iv lasix two time however lab result suggest that congestive heart failure be not a large part of her presentation first the brain natriuretic peptide that be send show a value of proximally which be approximately a baseline of suggest that she be not have an acute exacerbation of her heart failure in addition the patient creatinine increase from her outside hospital value of when it be first check at in the morning on january at clinchau hospital it be she receive her two dos of lasix one on the night of november and then again in the morning of january her creatinine in the afternoon of march increase to urine electrolyte be send and the acute renal failure workup will be discuss below under the renal section in term of her heart failure the patient be give iv fluid and do not have any further symptom of heart failure her normal dose of mg of lasix every morning be restart on september and she will be continue on that dose rhythm the patient be monitor on telemetry and after her sinus tachycardia her heart rate come down a her hyperoxemia improve and she have no further issue ischemia the patient be continue on aspirin reductase inhibitor she be continue on her folic acid a well she be not put on a give her bronchospastic response to that but she be continue on her angiotensin receptor blocker after her acute renal failure resolve renal the patient be admit with a creatinine of from the outside hospital and when she first present her baseline be in the low a her baseline the peak creatinine during her stay be january at and it be her bun at that time be urine electrolyte be send which show a urine sodium of and creatinine of and that be only hour after the patient get her last dose of lasix it be felt that the patient have prerenal azotemia and be give iv fluid her creatinine improve and on may the patient creatinine be approximately her baseline her bun at that time be increase from on april the patient will be monitor a an outpatient to make sure that her lasix dose be not too high musculoskeletal the patient creatine kinase be elevate on admission to it be rechecked on april and it be it be felt that this be due to two factor increase release from the muscle a the patient be only which be less than and the troponin be negative so this be felt to be due to her increased work of breathing and release from the muscle and exacerbate by her acute renal failure and retention of the creatine kinase her creatine kinase decrease by july to therefore it be not felt that the patient have rhabdomyolysis cause renal failure but rather renal failure cause retention of creatine kinase disease from increase work of breathe hematology the patient be continue on her coumadin the patient inr throughout her stay remain therapeutic between and on may it be she be continue on her home dose the patient white blood cell count be elevate at admission at the outside hospital with a left shift she be start on levofloxacin and steroid therefore it be difficult to interpret her white count deferential her white count remain elevated between and throughout her stay her neutrophil count remain between and of that a urinalysis be send which do not suggest that the patient have a urinary tract infection the patient tsh be with a normal of she will be follow up a an outpatient a this may represent subclinical hyperthyroidism in addition to her thyroid the patient osteoporosis be continue to be treat with calcium carbonate vitamin d and fosamax during her stay rheumatology the patient be continue on her probenecid mg two time a day she have no symptom of gout psychiatry the patient be continue on her clonazepam and celexa she be not continue on ritalin and will not be discharge on her ritalin give her tachycardia in addition the patient do not feel that the ritalin be help her pain the patient vioxx be discontinue because of her renal issue this will also not be one of her discharge medication and it should be reassess by her primary care doctor the benefit may outweigh the risk but this should be up to satterfield who have a relationship with the patient infectious disease the patient have blood culture send which be negative at

abnormality for the remainder of her postoperative course multiple conversion attempt be make both pharmaceutically as well a with electrocardioversion but she occasionally do covert to normal sinus rhythm ultimately she revert back into atrial fibrillation the third postoperative day she become hypotensive and asystolic chest compression be initiate for less than one minute at which time atrial pacing be initiate and her rhythm be regain with adequate blood pressure though she be return on to several day of active drip to support her blood pressure from this point pavick develop dependence on pressor and inotropic agent to support her blood pressure and cardiovascular system after several month with no real recovery of her cardiovascular status the family decide to withdraw care and put

disease in his pda it be determine to far treat the patient coronary artery disease with medical management after his heart rate be control with amiodarone and with a pacemaker he do however continue to have some fatigue and shortness of breath a a result he have an adenosine mibi to evaluate for functional ischemia give the finding on his catheterization the mibi show a moderate size perfusion

wall with reduced thicken he do not have any ekg change during the procedure his beta blockade be increase to lopressor and he continue on his nitrate he be actually able to tolerate ambulation without feel any pain or shortness of breath it be possible that the symptom that he have later on in the hospitalization be secondary to volume overload which respond well to diuresis he will follow up with rafi it be unlikely that any intervention will be able to be do but he will explore this a an outpatient pump the patient do experience some shortness of breath several day into his admission he have be approximately four liter positive over several day he be give mg of iv lasix and respond well he be send home with mg of lasix monday and thursday rhythm the patient electrocardiogram and telemetry strip be concern because while he be technically in normal sinus rhythm he be usually only in normal sinus rhythm for beat at a time at most and in between that have several run of nsvt the nsvt never progress to sustain and the patient be always hemodynamically stable however there be concern that this could ultimately progress to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation he be load on amiodarone mg which he tolerate well he also require an additional mg iv x load to stabilize his rhythm he have an icd and ddi pacemaker place on without complication after the pacemaker be place he be still experience some fatigue and it be think that he may have be overpaced a a result his setting be adjust to increase his av delayed and he be change to ddd mode he also have a number of beat

534,cg be right chronic leg ulcer sign dis admission date report status sign discharge date date of admission attend derocher shaun antonio md addendum admission to the icu this will be the hospital course and plan as well a the discharge medication hospital course low extremity wound the patient have several left low extremity wound which by report have be chronic as well a a deep acute onset right low extremity wound which be ulcerate to the level of muscle it be think that this wound have occur a a result of a hematoma after incision and drainage by surgical service one to two week prior to admission there be no obvious evidence of infection however it be certainly possible that there be a soft tissue surround that ulcer there be some thought of whether that could be osteomyelitis underlie the ulcer the patient have tibial and fibula film which at first there be some consideration of whether there be abnormality to the bone on further consideration it be felt this be most likely not the case however to evaluate more specifically a bone scan be perform there be no uptake in the area of that ulcer however there be some mild uptake at the left achilles tendon calcaneal insertion and mark uptake in the thoracic vertebrae a cat scan of the spine be perform which reveal no evidence of infection or neoplasm but there be evidence of osteopenia and possibly a microfracture but no evidence of real compression fracture the patient be see and examine by the vascular surgery consult service and smallidge her primary vascular surgeon their recommendation in term of wound dressing be three time a day dress change with x gauze sponge it be recommend that the patient follow up with goolden in mid please call usman office for an appointment the recommendation for three time a day dress without additional ointment or treatment the patient should be follow by wound care service in addition the patient have small necrotic region on her heel these should be treat with panafil in term of her sacral decubitus ulcer the patient be see by the plastic surgery service they debrided the wound twice there be minimal amount of superficial necrotic tissue which be excise their recommendation for further care be to apply strength dakin solution soak dressing to be change twice a day for hour that will be for hour from discharge and then this treatment should be change to standard dressing twice daily to that sacral decubitus ulcer they recommend that she be place on an air mattress she should have turn at least every hour they also recommend that her weight be keep off the sacrum and that her nutrition be optimize she be place on a multivitamin continue on calcium start on zinc vitamin c supplement a well the patient should follow up with roscoe szymonik a an outpatient this should be schedule by call infectious disease the patient be initially admit with a temperature it be unclear whether she have a primary infection and what the source of that infection be culture be take from blood urine and sputum all blood culture be negative urine culture grow extend spectrum resistant klebsiella pneumonia which be intermediate to ciprofloxacin and sensitive to levofloxacin because the patient have so little urine output it be unclear whether at first this be a colonizer or an actual infection infectious disease consultation be request their recommendation be to start ciprofloxacin and then this be change to levofloxacin when the final susceptibility come back and they continue that for a course she be currently on levofloxacin mg iv this course will finish on sputum culture grow multidrug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa as well a a few acinetobacter which be also resistant to many antibiotic after close consultation with infectious disease consultation service it be decide that these be most likely colonizer there be no evidence of an acute pneumonia or tracheobronchitis and the patient be not treat for her colonization with acinetobacter and pseudomonas in the past she have have multiple other multiple drug resistant organism that grow from her sputum culture at other institution and it be felt that unless she demonstrate evidence of clinical pulmonary infection these should not be treat overall her hemodynamic status be stable and she be afebrile throughout her course several day into her admission however she do have one episode of low blood pressure initially treat with intravenous fluid and then norepinephrine infusion for short period of time however on repeat cuff pressure manually it be reveal that her blood pressure actually be normal and that there be dysfunction possibly because of her obesity of the automatic cuff therefore it be think that this low blood pressure be spurious and probably an artifact of the cuff that be be use so in conclusion the only medication on discharge will be levofloxacin mg through cardiovascular the patient have a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation she be on toprol mg by mouth two time a day throughout her stay her heart rate range from when she be first admit to on discharge this should be readdressed regularly in term of her need for rate control at this point she will be discharge on that low dose of otherwise she be admit on coumadin with a inr of for her jude aortic valve her inr be therapeutic on admission this be actually discontinue after a couple of day in anticipation of a possible procedure it be restart three day prior to discharge she be on heparin a a bridge for anticoagulation in the meantime she should be continue on the heparin with a goal ptt of until her inr be therapeutic at and this should be rechecked to make sure that her inr remain therapeutic her care be discuss with her primary cardiologist sean mesa endocrine the patient have a history of type diabetes her diabetes be control with insulin nph unit subcutaneous every morning with a regular insulin slide scale

time however it do seem that she have improve to some degree in term of her ventilatory mechanic she be currently on pressure support ventilation at of pressure support and of positive end expiratory pressure with an of we believe that she could probably be wean slowly to significantly decreased pressure support and i believe most likely she will be able at some point to be take off the ventilator although this be certainly not certain she will be continue on her nebulizer treatment nutrition the patient be continue on tube feed she be on full strength nepro at cc per hour in addition she be get vitamin c supplementation ascorbic acid mg by mouth two time a day nephrocaps zinc sulfate mg by mouth daily and these should be continue a indicated for her renal failure and wound heal psychiatric the patient be continue on her home dose of fluoxetine mg by g tube daily and on zyprexa mg by g tube at bedtime prophylaxis throughout her stay the patient be continue on her home esomeprazole mg by g tube twice a day and for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis her inr on coumadin remain above and her ptt be keep therapeutic on intravenous heparin intravenous heparin should be continue with ptt check on admission and then every hour unit they be fairly stable between and and that should be monitor at least daily until her inr be stably therapeutic it will be very important to monitor her inr carefully while she be on levofloxacin a well access the patient have a midline which be place in mid this should be remove within the next one week and another line place a prefer by the rehabilitation physician in addition the patient dialysis catheter while functional do seem to have erode through the skin below her clavicle the hemodialysis service should be aware and

sleepiness she be admit to the general medical service on with a history of confusion visual change ataxia tinnitus bilateral low extremity edema and shortness of breath she have also have easy bruising and a severe episode of epistaxis require cauterization her blood work be notable for pancytopenia she then have swelling of her hand and arm as well a a rash mri in showed no change or evidence of tumor recurrence the patient while on the general medical service have an extensive rheumatologic neurologic and hematologic workup at which point she undergo both bone marrow biopsy and unsuccessful lp under iv conscious sedation the patient become unresponsive and hypothermic about hour after her bone marrow biopsy and be therefore transfer to the micu on for close observation she seem encephalopathic during this stay and be start empirically on ampicillin cefoxitin and acyclovir she be then send for a lumbar puncture require intubation she be extubated on she be then transfer out to the floor where she continue to improve hospital course in more detail by system below hospital course the patient have a history of obstructive sleep apnea and use cpap at home her outpatient pulmonologist at the ceanmin chbre memorial be contact who confirm this on admission she have a normal saturation with a relatively clear chest however she become hypothermic and unresponsive follow her bone marrow biopsy she also require intubation for lumbar puncture for airway protection in the setting of her excessive sedation she be extubated on and her oxygen be quickly wean off since then she have be oxygenate and ventilate well on room air cpap be continue at night she have have no other pulmonary complication cvs the patient have no history of cardiac disease an echocardiogram do on show normal lv function with preserved ejection fraction no wall motion abnormality moderate tricuspid regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation in term of her rhythm the patient have a rest bradycardia in the to that be think to be secondary to increase vagal tone and have no hemodynamic consequence she receive atropine while in the icu at mg x on two separate occasion in the first instance for bradycardia to a heart rate of in the setting of get vasoconstrictor for a low blood pressure and the second time when she have a heart rate down to after the patient be transfer out to the floor we do obtain a dedicated ep service cardiology consult who evaluate the patient they confirm that her bradycardia be most likely due to vagal tone she respond appropriately with an increase in her heart rate with exertion in this young woman it be deem that a pacemaker would not be an appropriate choice she do have second pause on one occasion on the floor but have no recurrence throughout the rest of her stay if after discharge she develop further pause or a syncopal episode this issue can be revisit while she be in house we do keep atropine and zoll pad at the bedside but do not have to use it once she be transfer out of the icu in term of ischemia the patient have a slightly elevate on admission but she have have a normal echocardiogram and negative troponin since renal the patient develop acute renal failure during the early part of her stay think secondary to acyclovir which have be give for presumptive meningitis her abdominal ultrasound be negative and urine eosinophil be also negative her creatinine improve with appropriate hydration and be normal at the time of discharge creatinine equal to the patient do have a history of hypernatremia initially her home ddavp be hold for fear that it would be difficult to diurese her if she become volume overload give her somewhat elevated creatinine however her sodium continue to increase to despite get free water repletion so her ddavp be restart on she be discharge on her home dose of ddavp of mg and mg with one nasal spray her sodium at the time of discharge be she have be follow by the endocrine service in house for this they have recommend that she not increase her home dose instead she will aggressively increase her water intake in order to maintain her normal sodium she will follow up in two week with kearley of endocrine who will recheck her electrolyte at that time the patient be evaluate by both of these service during her stay she have biopsy do of several location that show nonspecific pathology consistent with mixed connective tissue disease however her serology have for the most part be negative she be treat presumptively with and eventually pulse steroid these be tapered towards her stay she will be discharge on a quick taper of hydrocortisone mg for two day after which she will revert to her home dose of mg and mg endocrine the patient have panhypopituitarism and be follow by the endocrine service throughout her stay in term of her thyroid function the patient be continue on her home dose of levoxyl it be difficult to interpret her tsh in the setting of panhypopituitarism therefore we follow her and free level these be rechecked towards the end of her stay once she have recover from her acute illness and in light of a slightly decrease free level her levoxyl be increase to mcg daily at the time of discharge diabetes insipidus the patient hypernatremia be correct with water and increase her fluid intake she be also put back on her home dose of ddavp growth hormone there be no indication for growth hormone replacement adrenal insufficiency the patient complete a course of stress dose steroid for her procedure and then get pulse steroid per wound for a question of lupus versus mixed connective tissue disorder however this be taper over her stay and she will be discharge on a very brief taper she will go back to her home regimen of hydrocortisone gonadotropins the patient be continue on aviane ocp during her stay neurologic the patient have no clear etiology for her hypersomnolence she be follow by the neurologic service in house she do not appear to be hypercarbic or hypoxic her infectious workup be entirely negative and she be therefore take off antibiotic her eeg show nonspecific diffuse slow with no seizure foci the default diagnosis have be that some of her symptom include her altered mental status lower extremity edema rash and perhaps even pancytopenia may be secondary to provigil this be therefore discontinue and she should not start this once she return home initially her stimulant be hold for fear that they be contribute to her pancytopenia however her ritalin be restart once her count start to recover she be discharge on mg her mental status seem to improve on this regimen at the time of discharge she be awake alert able to converse well and at her baseline hematologic the patient present with pancytopenia again of unclear etiology bone marrow biopsy be negative for leukemia lymphoma and myelodysplasia rather it be consistent with a viral effect or drug effect her count have resolve by the time of discharge with a white blood count equal to hematocrit of and platelet of this too may have be due to provigil effect prophylaxis the patient be maintain on pepcid for gi prophylaxis and heparin for dvt prophylaxis code full id the patient have multiple blood urine culture and csf culture send these be all negative of note stool culture be positive for difficile she be therefore start on flagyl mg on she will complete a course of this antibiotic disposition home with vna service condition on discharge satisfactory complication during this hospital stay none to plan the patient should follow up with her pcp in week the patient should follow up with bodenstein in the endocrine department in week she can be reach at the patient should aggressively increase her oral water

abnormal rhythm be presume to be ventricular tachycardia give her history of severe ischemic heart disease once her tachycardia be stabilize she be take to catheterization which show patent graft she do have a small increase in her troponin but this be think to be relate to demand she do not have any complaint of chest pain during the hospitalization we continue her on her beta blocker and initially hold her digoxin while we be control her rhythm she be slightly hypotensive during her episode of tachycardia so we initially hold her accupril as well but her medication be resume a few day before discharge pump at the time of admission the patient be classify a have class ii heart failure although she do admit to not be very active and it be felt that if the patient exert herself more she would have more symptom on her catheterization her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure be find to be with a normal right atrial pressure she also have a repeat echocardiogram which show an ejection

fluid restriction but her creatinine soon begin to increase from a baseline level of to a peak of the patient do admit that she drink a significantly large amount of fluid at home and so she be quite hypovolemic in comparison to what she be normally use to a a result we liberalize her fluid restriction and her creatinine normalize rhythm when the patient arrive her tachycardia resolve and she be in normal sinus rhythm however later that even she go back into ventricular tachycardia she have stay in ventricular tachycardia with her heart rate often reach the for several minute at a time her blood pressure be always stable in the she deny any chest pain she be give an amiodarone load of mg iv x over minute and also start on a load of mg over the next two day she continue to have episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia for five minute at a time and ultimately her ventricular tachycardia progress so that she would have episode of minute at a time when she become symptomatic she be start on an amiodarone drip this be do through a peripheral line and after several hour the patient develop a mild phlebitis she be take off the drip and place again on amiodarone her vtac be think to be primarily due to her ischemic cardiomyopathy and we discuss the need for an icd with her she be reluctant but ultimately agree we do also discuss the possibility of an ep study and ablation but the patient prefer the least invasive method possible while the patient be currently in compensate heart failure a mention previously it be felt that this be because she do not exert herself any further and that it be likely that she would within the next year or two decompensate and have more symptom of congestive heart failure because of the severity of her disease a pacemaker be also place at the same time a the icd the patient tolerate the procedure well by the time of discharge her amiodarone be decrease to this will likely be decrease to a an outpatient she do not have any more episode of

be on the of july she also be admit with acute renal failure her creatinine on the of june per note be when we admit her creatinine be this be likely secondary to the fact that she have receive amikacin for urinary tract infection at the tawno health and she have also have a chest abdominal and pelvis contrast ct lead to contrast nephropathy when she be admit her main problem be the following she have a elevation myocardial infarction she be a patient with a timi score of she have acute renal failure probably secondary to a number of factor include contrast dye what she have receive at the outside hospital and amikacin which she have receive for urinary tract infection her other problem be she have a urinary tract infection per report secondary to coli resistant to

not interventionally give her acute renal failure she be treat with unfractionated heparin with a ptt level of to second she be give aspirin plavix she be also give eptifibatide intravenously for five day and be also treat with beta blocker and ace inhibitor after five day she have no recurrent chest pain her ekg change be persistent but her troponin level have trend downwards and she have really be asymptomatic in this regard regard her pulmonary edema we treat with lasix initially mg iv lasix and then on stand po lasix mg daily and diuresed her and also give her morphine and oxygen within four or five day her physical examination be much good and her crackle and rale have markedly decrease on admission she be saturate on she progress her oxygen requirement decrease she be diuresed and be finally wean off oxygen and be currently saturate on room air the plan be for her to continue on aspirin plavix lipitor and and nitrate a need in term of her acute renal failure base on the record from the trickvan agi health network her creatinine have jump from to in three day this be felt to be most likely due to intrinsic renal failure she do not have a low urine output and she have receive amikacin in the past few day prior to admission as well a contrast dye and she do have a history of contrast dye induce nephropathy lead to a predialysis state although she do not get dialysis on that occasion here we simply avoid nephrotoxic agent be judicious in the use of lasix with strict control and her creatinine gradually begin to decrease and today it be down to infectious disease wise she come with the documented urinary tract infection report to be due to coli resistant to levofloxacin and gentamicin here we culture her again and find coli more than a colony which be resistant to ampicillin gentamicin ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin it be sensitive to ceftazidime and she therefore receive renally dose ceftazidime for her uti to complete a to course blood culture draw on the of april show no growth to date the patient have also be afebrile in with a white blood cell count between and in term of her hypertension of note it have be difficult to measure her blood pressure probably measure her blood pressure in her left arm by palpation be a most reliable way to do this she be treat here with hydralazine lopressor and diuretic on discharge she feel well today she tell

post mastectomy and chemotherapy rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation who be find pause of up to second on a holter monitor and be admit for consideration of pacer placement the patient state that over the last several month since october she have note increase dyspnea on exertion and decreased exercise tolerance she also have notice episode of palpitation she present to her primary care physician in october with these complaint he put a holter monitor on her which show her to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rate between and with a mean rate of beat per minute her primary care physician esmond initially put the patient on digoxin and coumadin her rate remain elevated however so he change the coumadin to cardizem about one month ago he also add propafenone mg on she present to her cardiologist cowser complaining of continued palpitation and ankle edema he stop her cardizem at that time a he felt that be what be contribute to her low extremity edema and place her on atenolol mg instead she have a leepy holter monitor place from wednesday morning her second day of atenolol she note have episode where i felt my heart pause and then surge when it start to beat again this be associate with lightheadedness x several second she do not have any associate chest pain shortness of breath nausea and vomit diaphoresis or syncope she call cedotal on and he tell her to stop her atenolol and continue her propafenone over the last two day she have have flutter episode of irregular heart beat but have have no lightheadedness since stop the atenolol on wednesday she have note increased shortness of breath over the last couple of day as well on climb one flight of stair she also have orthopnea use two pillow at night do not have pnd do have low extremity edema on the day of admission which be mcferrin receive a transmitted holter record from viewden medical center that show the patient have normal sinus rhythm with episode of atrial fibrillation with high rate but also that she have episode of second pause thus she call the patient and have her sent via ambulance to the cole general health emergency department for consideration of admission for pacemaker placement in the emergency department the patient vitals be she be afebrile with a pulse of blood pressure breathe satting on room air her review of system be negative for fever chill or

be esr be which be what it have be in july inr be chest show cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular redistribution electrocardiogram show a normal sinus rhythm at with a normal axis normal interval she do have leave atrial enlargement as well a right atrial enlargement her last echo do at mh on show an ejection fraction of concentric leave ventricular hypertrophy lv systolic function preserve a thickened mitral valve moderate to severe mitral regurgitation plus left atrial enlargement aortic valve thicken mild ai no a moderate tricuspid regurgitation moderately increase pulmonary artery pressure normal rv plus her atrial enlargement and they make note that the mitral regurgitation be increase on this echo when compare with an echo do one year prior at bktmc past medical history breast cancer status post leave mastectomy with lymph node dissection in pathology reveal invasive ductal carcinoma grade node negative she be status post four cycle of adriamycin and cytoxan history

history she be a nurse currently on a medical leave of absence she live alone tobacco history she do smoke pack per day since she be no ethanol family history brother with sarcoid plus a history of hypertension father with prostate cancer hospital course cardiovascular from an ischemia standpoint she rule out for a myocardial infarction we do continue her antihypertensive regimen of lisinopril from a pump standpoint we felt that perhaps her mitral regurgitation be the main cause of her month history of increase dyspnea on exertion exercise intolerance and increase orthopnea thus we get a repeat echo which show borderline leave ventricular hypertrophy with an estimate ejection fraction of normal rv the mitral valve be moderately thickened and rheumatic in appearance the mitral valve area be estimate at cm square although this may have an under estimate there be severe mitral regurgitation and moderate leave atrial enlargement the aortic valve be calcify there be mild aortic insufficiency there be mild tricuspid regurgitation with a regurgitant velocity of consistent with mild elevation in pulmonary systolic pressure of approximately mmhg plus right atrial pressure give her severe and symptomatic mitral regurgitation we then decide that she would likely benefit from a mitral valve replacement then we proceed to cardiac catheterization her left heart catheterization show a leave dominant system with clean coronary artery her right heart catheterization reveal elevated right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressure and elevate pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of she be diuresed several kg from her admission weight with iv lasix and she be continue on her ace inhibitor for afterload reduction consultation with mazingo of cardiothoracic surgery be obtain and he felt that patient would indeed benefit greatly from an mvr thus plan be make for patient to be discharge home and then to be readmitted electively when brocks return from vacation for an mvr from a rate and rhythm standpoint the patient be in normal sinus rhythm for the majority of her hospital stay we continue her propafenone and coumadin for her history of atrial fibrillation and she do have excellent rate control on this she have no further pause on telemetry during hospital stay and thus it be felt that give she be asymptomatic and do not have any pause off of beta blockade that she do not need pacemaker placement on this admission pulmonary from a pulmonary standpoint we felt that likely she have cardiac asthma a with diuresis her wheezing and shortness of breath be nearly improve rheumatology from a rheumatologic standpoint her lupus be in good control she do not have of her typical lupus flare symptom such a arthralgia or rash fever and thus we continue her on her plaquenil her chloroquine and her prednisone renal she do not appear to have any renal involvement of her lupus and her renal function be within normal limit throughout her stay heme she have a normal cytic anemia at which be within her baseline range of full iron study be send and it be felt that it be most likely consistent with anemia of chronic disease prophylaxis from a prophylaxis standpoint she be on coumadin for atrial fibrillation so be not consider for heparin and she be continue on prilosec throughout her stay discharge medication plaquenil mg lisinopril mg magnesium gluconate gram prednisone mg propafenone mg coumadin mg meq flovent mg inhale flonase spray nasally for her allergy and postnasal drip prevacid mg chloroquine mg lasix mg followup she have an appointment to follow

only relatively recently restart he have be maintain at a dose of mcg in the past when he be restart on synthroid by the outpatient endocrinologist escudero his synthroid be start at a relatively low dose and titrate slowly upwards because of his severe cardiomyopathy and there be concern that increase his dose too quickly would precipitate angina on admission his tsh be and after some discussion with pimpare his synthroid be increase to mcg on an endocrine consult be request because on his repeat tsh of of and a thbr of endocrine consult recommend increase synthroid to mcg and slowly titrate synthroid upwards by no more than mcg q week to a goal of mcg per day again slowly titrate upwards to reduce the risk of precipitate angina further management of his hypothyroidism could be do on an outpatient basis the patient also on admission have a history of type ii diabetes maintain on insulin his insulin dos have be titrate downwards during his hospital diabetes mellitus because of low fingersticks likely secondary to a relatively healthy diet while in the hospital he require only unit of lantus insulin he be discharge on that dose with humalog unit subcu and to be follow and
