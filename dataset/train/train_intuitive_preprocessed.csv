that the patient have the most difficulty with postprandial sugar often after lunch and dinner therefore we recommend that if she continue to have hyperglycemia that it would be best to titrate the aspartate it would be best to avoid titrate the lantus too much give that her fasting sugar in the morning be often normal the patient have no hypoglycemic episode during this admission of note the

this admission demonstrate the patient ef at this point to be rather with global hypokinesis operation or procedure there be no operation or procedure perform during this admission hospital course by problem cardiovascular the patient be determine initially to be likely in congestive heart failure with elevated neck vein and increase leg edema and a low blood pressure because the patient be determine to be in chf he be diuresed with iv lasix and later with lasix the patient be diuresed approximately liter per day over a period the blood pressure subsequently rise after consultation with cardiology it be determine that a beta blocker and an ace inhibitor should be add to the patient medication regimen a his blood pressure would allow for demonstrated benefit and congestive heart failure because the patient be initially determine to have some risk of myocardial infarction have report chest pain the day prior to admission and have slightly elevate troponins the troponin and be follow until they begin decrease it be likely that these very small elevation be due to small amount of ischemia from demand due to the patient fluid overload and anemia the patient be continue on his

point he have no problem with urinate the patient be maintain on proscar in addition to flomax heme the patient hematocrit drop be likely due to two factor first of all the patient be know to have be lose blood in the form of clot from his bladder this be likely due to bleed from the surface of his prostate where a recent cystoscopy have demonstrate tortuous vein in addition the reading of hematocrit of on admission be likely secondary to dilution the patient be massively fluid overload the patient hematocrit rise after diuresis and be maintain in the range without transfusion during

with ascites and palpable liver edge his extremity be warm without edema hospital course from the cardiac standpoint we initially attempt to diurese him iv torsemide mg however he do not respond well enough to this regimen and therefore we start drip with zaroxolyn we also stop his isordil and ace inhibitor early on because of blood pressure in the on admission his creatinine be and on the next day of admission it be with low blood pressure at which point we decide to start a dopamine drip at mcg per hour however his urine output be only about cc negative so we further increase the lasix drip from mg an hour to mg an hour after mg iv lasix bolus on this combination of the lasix drip at an hour and dopamine at mcg per hour he begin to have very good and effective urine output at approximately liter per day negative also reflect in his total weight and come in with admission weight of around kg on each day he diuresed about an half to kilo off until the day of discharge at which point he be less than kg we monitor strict i and o check daily weight during the course of his diuresis his sodium level be decrease mostly secondary to the patient drink a lot of free water the combination of free water intake in the setting of natriuresis result in further worsening of his hyponatremia from an admission sodium of to eventually to we strictly reinforce the need to limit his fluid intake to less than liter per day and at that point his sodium level than rebound to and also on the day of discharge we monitor the lytes eventually his blood pressure remain stable his jvp decrease from to on admission to about to and continue to have good urine output thus we wean off the dopamine but continue the lasix drip for one more day we then discontinue the lasix drip and transition him back over to torsemide which be his home regimen and watch him for another hour he continue to diurese at this dose but then on the day of discharge his i and o be finally about cc negative which be a change from about to liter negative per day his jvp be about to and his creatinine be stable at we his isordil at mg for the last hour and his blood pressure be stable in the give his potassium which be always borderline low in the or range we decide to increase his aldactone dose to mg but give his underlying renal insufficiency we have decrease his stand from meq a day to meq a day an echo be do which show an ejection fraction of and they do not comment on the synchrony on the preliminary report however he be a candidate for pace give his mildly widen qrs complex stage iii

not in dka a the patient level of betahydroxybutyrate of be not enought to explain the patient gap or all his metabolic disturbances the endocrine service that more likely the patient have hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic acidosis and also severe pancreatitis initial screen for the cause of pancreatitis be negative include stone the patient have significant alcohol history and have be drink alcohol which be the most likely cause of his severe pancreatic insufficiency the patient be aggressively hydrate with iv fluid and his metabolic abnormality begin to correct he be also note by lab to be in acute renal failure and a renal consult be obtain the patient nonoliguric renal failure be in the setting of severe dehydration secondary to hyperosmolar state and ace inhibitor be

creatinine and bun return to normal however in the night of of june the patient abdominal pain worsen and there be a question of peritoneal sign which prompt an emergent exploratory laparotomy to rule

medical intensive care unit he be start on tpn and with a slow wean of his of dextrose his blood sugar normalize on of june the patient renal function have also normalize the patient by of september have mark decrease abdominal pain normalized electrolyte and his renal function be at his baseline with a creatinine of the patient be transfer out of the medical intensive care unit to our service on of may on tpn and the following medication digoxin mg carafate one gram albuterol two puff aspirin mg he be also on tpn but be be advance to a clear liquid diet and seem to be tolerate it well he also continue to require a large amount of insulin through his tpn and also through his slide scale the patient do well and be able to tolerate a clear liquid diet and be advance in the next two day to a soft solid diet with very low fat i will dictate the rest of the patient event assessment and plan by problem list a follow gi severe pancreatitis the patient be able to be advance to a soft solid diet for the past few day she have abdominal pain which have almost resolve and then resume and the patient develop a watery diarrhea it be felt that this could be due to pancreatic insufficiency versus diff colitis and therefore diff sample be send and the patient be presumptively start on flagyl and pancrease unit hour before meal the patient abdominal pain and diarrhea persist this prompt u to make the patient once more and another abdominal ct be obtain an abdominal ct perform on of march show progression of pancreatitis with increase inflammatory change there be no necrosis or pseudocyst formation note also note be some significant small bowel dilatation without any evidence of obstruction therefore the patient be continue to be keep and tpn be restart on of april the patient have tolerate this well and at this time have no longer have any abdominal pain either subjectively or on exam it do occasionally have mild low back pain which be think to actually be due to his pancreatitis a oppose to any musculoskeletal cause ii diarrhea the patient also have diarrhea a noted above he have be work up extensively his diarrhea have now resolve he be diff negative but be treat presumptively with flagyl for seven day all stool study include shigella salmonella campylobacter ovum and parasite microsporidia have be negative his stool have be send for quantitative fecal fast which be still pending on discharge he have be repeatedly guaiac negative a note above his diarrhea have resolve iii resolve heme positivity the patient earlier in the course of his intensive care unit stay have some stool that be heme positive they be think to be due to gastritis he have now be on initially after that have be on prilosec and now change over to ranitidine in his tpn and have have multiple guaiac negative stool in the past ten day iv small perianal ulcer the patient be note to have a small perianal ulcer it be felt to be secondary to pressure from lie in bed and also secondary to his multiple episode of diarrhea which have be go on for day it be felt that this should resolve if it do not it be suggest that the ulcer be swab and send for hsv endocrine insulin dependent diabetes mellitus due to the pancreatic insufficiency the patient will be a life long diabetic the patient have be follow by the endocrine service and be now receive unit of insulin per liter through his tpn he be also on a slide scale regular regimen with finger stick it be felt that this should be a relatively stable regimen for him at this time a the patient be wean off his tpn and start to take again he should be switch over to nph with regular insulin check on a slide scale before his meal the patient also have a appointment with the diabetes clinic in three week a noted below cardiovascular the patient do have a history of congestive heart failure and have have mild crackle throughout his stay here this have not limit him in any way he have have a good oxygen saturation the patient continue to take mg of lasix on the day of discharge he receive an extra mg iv a he have be i os positive for the last few day and we note a slightly more crackle on his exam of note the patient have a long history of have paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but have be do relatively well here his current medical regimen include isordil mg captopril mg both of these can be titrate upwards a his blood pressure allow he have have some labile blood pressure range anywhere from the systolics of to while in the hospital and he have never be symptomatic and even when he have be he have have blood pressure in the and have tolerate this well he be also maintain on digoxin mg he be also take aspirin for his cardiac regimen pulmonary the patient have good saturation and usually range from to on room air and have have no pulmonary problem he have have bibasilar crackle on exam which be felt to be due to some mild congestive heart failure for which he be take lasix he may need some extra dos of lasix per your direction the next few day heme the patient hematocrit have be low in the high on two occasion in both case always drift down slowly think to be due to delutional effect plus repeat a phlebotomy he have be transfuse a total of three unit while he have be in the hospital here otherwise be hematocrit have be stable for multiple day so have his platelet also of note the patient have be heme negative from below for more than ten day renal the patient say his baseline creatinine in which his acute renal failure have resolve rhabdomyolysis this have also resolve with the patient cks have normalize over a week ago infectious disease the patient have remain afebrile normal white count for many day while here he be also presumptively treat for diff which be actually find to be negative on his stool examination with no fecal leukocytes the temperature curve should be follow give that the patient continue to have pancreatitis and be at risk for develop a phlegmon assessment and plan severe pancreatitis the patient continue to be on tpn a picc line have be place and a triple lumen catheter will be remove prior to transfer of the patient it be our feeling that the patient should remain on tpn for the next two day and then a per your direction the patient could be slowly advance on a diet a tolerate we feel that the patient deserve another trial to see if he can tolerate before any long term decision be make regard his nutrition and perhaps placement of a for long term feed the patient amylase and lipase on the day of discharge be for amylase and for lipase these value continue to remain low even when the patient be have abdominal pain this be felt to be due to a relatively burnt out pancreas a gi consult be also obtain which agree with this assessment it be felt that when the patient do start take again he should have pancreas at least to unit half hour before meal due to his pancreatic exocrine insufficiency also the patient should be follow clinically very closely include his white count fever curve and his abdominal exam for any sign and symptom of development of an infection or phlegmon or pseudocyst because of his pancreatitis the patient tpn should be continue a note below endocrine insufficiency the patient a note above will require insulin both through be tpn and his fingersticks should be check every six hour a noted when the patient be switch over to a regimen we suggest per endocrine recommendation that nph be give and the patient should be cover with an insulin slide scale at bedtime the patient be be transfer to redist nalereamer memorial hospital on of april in good condition the patient today deny any abdominal pain nausea or vomit but occasionally continue to have mild back pain his diarrhea have resolve he be afebrile with a blood pressure of pulse be respiratory rate sit on room air with a weight of kg he be comfortable and have have bibasilar crackle of the way up his abdomen be soft

his amylase be and his lipase be disposition the patient be be discharge in good condition to lakesfic hospital medical center his primary care physician littmann be aware of the patient discharge and

puff digoxin mg lasix mg captopril mg isordil mg magnesium and potassium sliding scale through iv while be here diet the patient should remain for the next two day his tpn order upon discharge should

evidence of any abnormality there be a region of increase signal intensity on the and flair image involve the vasoganglion extend the corona radiata therefore give the fact that signal be see on the and flair not on the it be felt that this be at least day old therefore this be not felt to be either the cause nor an affect of the motor vehicle collision it be most likely represent an old cva which be not previously detect give the fact that the patient remain asymptomatic and have a normal neurological exam and radiographic data demonstrate that this infarct be more than day old and this be not far address an mra of his head and neck demonstrate tortuous vertebrobasilar system the of the neck be essentially normal however the left bifurcation be think to be without any significant stenosis the right bifurcation be probably without significant stenosis however could not be complete excluded give artifact this could be far follow up with an outpatient venous duplex of the carotid

trend upwards on the last two day of admission it be felt that this probably represent stress give all the recent procedure that be do include the catheterization and the electrophysiology study rather than infection the chest be perform on the which demonstrate no infiltrate this be review with an attend radiologist who report low lung volume otherwise it be essentially negative in addition a repeat urinalysis be perform the result be pending at the time of dictation however will be follow up prior to the discharge from the hospital the patient appear well and state that he be feel at his best since the accident however far workup for his white count be not perform at the present time however the patient be inform a the no hospital and the discharge summary which show that the

for secondary cardiac and neurological prophylaxis the lovenox be discontinue at the request of the electrophysiology service on the endocrine give the numerous contrast study initially his metformin be hold however he be later restart on this in addition he be continue on his glyburide and cover with slide scale insulin his blood sugar be never any significant problem during his hospitalization disposition the patient will be go to missp medical center in stable condition at the rehab he will continue to get physical therapy which he have receive in the hospital it be felt that a short

be felt this be perhaps due to a mild urine infection and be start on levaquin however he start the next day complain increase pain in his knee at this time his white count have rise to the knee be obviously a concern for possible infection his knee be warm be tender and be erythematous compare to the contralateral side a a result the orthopedic service be again consult an arthrocentesis be perform on his left knee this be a dry tap no fluid be able to be obtain the subsequent day he be complain of increase pain and the sed rate return in the with a crp of the ep service again evaluate

be ambulate hall and be chest tightness free coronary artery disease be felt to be a noncontributory factor to his chf exacerbation pump the patient have an ejection fraction of upon admission with mitral regurgitation he be initially diuresed approximately liter with a combination of lasix and natrecor at this point his pulmonary edema have resolve and his oxygen requirement be decrease give the fact of his tenuous renal status we want to avoid further diuresis or reduction until we know exactly what his right and leave heart filling pressure be the patient be take to the cardiovascular diagnostic laboratory and receive a right heart catheterization his pulmonary capillary wedge pressure be determine to be and his pulmonary artery pressure his ra pressure be there be some initial false elevation because of inadequate sedation while in the cath lab and the patient be transfer for hour of tailored therapy to the cardiac care unit where he have a pulmonary artery catheter in place at this point his reduction be maximize with combination of hydralazine and isordil with good effect his creatinine decrease with reduction to his symptom improve and we be able to diurese another liter of the patient by discharge the patient be actually become hypertensive again and he be start on amlodipine a calcium channel blocker which he have tolerate in the past of note the patient have be expose to ace inhibition in the past and be currently not on an ace inhibitor in the past he have have a rise in his potassium to on ace inhibition on an outpatient basis in the future

an and fvc percent that be most consistent with a mild restriction his lung volume be approximately predicted suggestive of a restrictive process and his dlco both correct and uncorrected be predict his corrected dlco be it be unclear if the patient have underlie restrictive lung disease give the absence of definitive interstitial process on high resolution chest a more likely explanation for these finding be a residual pulmonary edema relate to inadequate diuresis with his congestive heart failure the patient be sate on room air at the time of discharge endocrine the patient have very difficult to control diabetes mellitus and be maintain on both nph and lispro slide scale while in house he be briefly hypoglycemic during his initial hospital course because of a urinary tract

of diabetes and hypertension he have have adverse reaction to contrast dye in the past with a creatinine bump to nearly we want to avoid as much contrast dye a possible during this hospital stay because of his renal insufficiency we end up his digoxin to three time weekly from every other day because of the dig level of his creatinine be and fall at the time of discharge and his bun be he be

antibiotic be change to penicillin and gentamycin a transesophageal echocardiogram be perform on the day of admission and do not demonstrate any vegetation however with persistent high spike fever sepsis and blood culture bottle repeat blood culture grow gbs the patient have repeat transesophageal echocardiogram this demonstrate a centimeter vegetation on the anterior annulus of the tricuspid

and he respond well by the following day at that time the eye be aspirate and note to also be infect by gbs the patient be inject intraocular with vancomycin at that time unfortunately the patient continue to spike fever despite appropriate therapy for his gb and his eye appear to be worsen with continued erythema conjunctival edema and a purulent exudate it be determine that the patient would require enucleation which he undergo on the patient also have a right low extremity cellulitis during his hospital course this be treat with a ten day course of dicloxacillin and resolve without complication the course be complicate by persistent fever despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and leave eye enucleation an extensive work up be undertake to evaluate the fever include evaluation for possible epidural abscess psoas abscess and infected joint none of these prove to be a source the patient underwent multiple joint aspiration see musculoskeletal section below without clear evidence of infection the patient also undergo a tagged white blood cell scan which demonstrate increase uptake in the left shoulder manubrium right knee leave ankle and mid shaft of the left tibia these be interpret both on the initial view and delayed view a consistent with acute inflammation but not diagnostic of infection a mention above the patient be also treat for cellulitis and underwent leave eye enucleation the patient fever curve trend down throughout the hospital stay and on the day prior to admission the patient underwent a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram to ensure that there be no myocardial abscess there be no evidence of any abscess and the vegetation be no longer visible it be felt that the low grade fever be secondary to ongoing inflammation but no acute infectious process at the time of discharge the patient last positive blood culture be of note there be concern that the patient fever could be secondary to a drug reaction therefore once the infectious work up be complete the penicillin be change to vancomycin his gram positive coverage will need to be continue for four week after his left eye enucleation ophthalmology a describe above the patient present with left eye pain and vision loss it be felt from the time of presentation that the patient would not recover vision in his left eye the patient be treat initially for his elevated pressure and then the following day his eye be aspirate and inject with vancomycin ultimately the patient have leave eye enucleation the patient eye heal well through the remainder of his hospital course and do not appear to be a source of infection thereafter the patient extraocular muscle be leave intact with the thought of place a prosthesis at a late date cardiovascular on admission the patient be note to have inversion anteriorly on his electrocardiogram however it rapidly become clear that his pacemaker be malfunction demonstrate only occasional pacing spike by the pacemaker be no longer capture or sense a mention above the wire do not appear to be incorporate in the vegetation note on the tricuspid valve however it do appear that the vegetation be hit the pacemaker wire with systole and diastole on the patient underwent pacemaker explantation without complication the indication for pacemaker placement have be for bradycardia there be some concern throughout the patient hospital course that the patient would become bradycardic without his pacemaker in place however this never manifest a a problem he do demonstrate some run of ventricular tachycardia during the early phase of his hospital course but this resolve a his sepsis resolve he do have one episode of supraventricular tachycardia think to be conduction of his atrial arrhythmia his lopressor be increase in response to this and the patient be tolerate this dose without episode of bradycardia or hypotension the patient a mention above underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram at the time of admission which demonstrate an ejection fraction of percent apical hypokinesis moderately dilate right ventricle with moderately depress systolic function mild inferior vena cava dilatation consistent with elevated right heart filling pressure the patient cardiac function appear to be stable throughout his hospitalization he do rule out for myocardial infarction at the time of admission musculoskeletal one of the patient major present complaint be significant arthralgia and myalgia it be though that along with left ophthalmitis the patient could have septic polyarthritis the patient underwent several arthrocentesis by the rheumatology service though the fluid do demonstrate elevate white blood cell count it be never clear that these be acutely infect there be no bacteria on gram stain or culture the patient right knee continue to be tender erythematous and warm during the initial part of the hospitalization therefore the patient go to arthroscopic examination on the patient knee be lavaged with liter of sterile saline prior to close all of the effusion be drain there be no complication the patient continue to have symptom of right knee effusion and pain and therefore return to the operating room on for repeat arthrocentesis since that time the right knee have reaccumulated a moderate size effusion but the patient have tolerate physical therapy and have regain a moderate amount of his range of motion it be determine that the patient should not have this effusion drain again because it be no long warm or erythematous the left shoulder be also quite tender during the initial hospital stay the patient underwent multiple joint aspiration of the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint both at the bed side and under fluoroscopic examination again this joint demonstrate elevated white blood cell count but never any clear evidence that it be a septic joint the patient after his left eye enucleation be note to have an elevated ck of it be think that this be an insignificant mb fraction it be not felt that there be enough manipulation to skeletal muscle during the enucleation to warrant this this rise in ck do coincide with increased muscle ache it be felt that the patient perhaps have a mild episode of rhabdomyolysis which resolve quickly to a ck of five day later at the time of discharge the patient be experience no myalgia or arthralgia with the exception of the right knee which be still somewhat limited in it range of motion and demonstrate an effusion but be respond well to rehabilitation pulmonary the patient be quite stable from a pulmonary standpoint throughout his hospitalization the patient be initially maintain in the emergency room on high flow oxygen however be quickly wean to nasal cannula and then room air the patient do have obstructive sleep apnea and use his bipap at night throughout his hospitalization hematology on admission the patient demonstrate a thrombocytopenia with a nadir of this have improve throughout his hospital course and on the day of discharge his platelet be note to be the patient be note to have hematocrit that trend down and correspond to some guaiac positive stool with anticoagulation the patient receive a total of four unit of packed red blood cell his hematocrit have remain stable with a good reticulocyte count at the time of discharge the patient be anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation initially with heparin and then ultimately with coumadin mg q hs the patient inr have be therapeutic in the range for approximately five day renal on admission the patient be note to have an elevate creatinine from his baseline of this be think to be secondary to dehydration and prerenal azotemia the creatinine reach a peak of and stabilize at at the time of discharge this appear to have resolve entirely with resolution of sepsis and rehydration the patient be significant dehydrate at the time of admission this respond rapidly to in vitro fertilization he also regain his appetite a his sepsis resolve the patient be note however to have a very poor albumen which be at the time of discharge the patient will require improved nutrition at rehabilitation and after discharge from rehabilitation the patient electrolyte be relatively stable throughout his hospital stay endocrine the patient have a long stand history of type ii diabetes mellitus on admission he be take metformin mg regular insulin q and q nph insulin q and q his hemoglobin be note to be elevate at in the patient metformin be hold throughout his hospital stay with the anticipation of possible invasive procedure he be maintain and nph insulin as well a slide scale insulin the patient be restart on his metformin prior to discharge and increase dose of nph insulin this will likely need to be adjust a the patient recovers far gastrointestinal the patient do develop guaiac positive stool during his anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation this will need to be follow up a an outpatient once the patient have make a full recovery from the acute event also the patient do demonstrate a mild transaminitis during his hospital stay and this appear to have resolve

ribbon like stool and complains of difficulty with bladder function as well a a sense of urgency to urinate her past medical history be significant for diverticulitis questionable inflammatory bowel disease gerd depression chronic pain and history of breast cancer her surgical history be significant for sigmoid colectomy in right breast lumpectomy axillary lymph node dissection in as well a multiple placement and endoscopic treatment she be admit on and take to the or for a sigmoid colectomy the procedure be complicate by a left ureteral injury for which urology be consult intraoperatively urology place a left ureteral stent intraoperatively and make recommendation to maintain stent for a total of six week after which time it would be remove on an outpatient basis mahaffy will be follow this case in addition they recommend maintain foley for five day the ebl during the case be cc necessitating transfusion of unit of packed red blood cell she be extubated and take to the pacu in stable condition with an epidural in place on perioperative antibiotic of clindamycin and with ng tube in place on postoperative day it be note that the patient be increasingly become confuse and anxious as well a remain tachycardic despite what be think to be adequate volume resuscitation and she be transfer to the unit at this point more specifically in addition to be tachycardic later that day on postoperative day she become tachypneic with noted hypoxemia and mental status change in need of intubation of note the patient be saturate at on oxygen via facemask it be also notable that the patient in the perioperative window receive of fluid resuscitation the night of postoperative day a mention earlier the patient be increasingly agitate before she be transfer to the unit and although discontinue her ng tube it be think at this time that she may have aspirate she also remove her supplemental oxygen and be note to have saturation in the range with tachycardia in the range a pe protocol ct be obtain that be negative for embolus or dvt but be positive for right upper lobe posterior segment consolidation that be consistent with an aspiration event she be subsequently transfer on the night of postoperative day to the icu intubate and have a right ij central line place overnight between postoperative day and postoperative day her blood pressure would drop require multiple fluid bolus in addition to the administration of an additional unit of packed red blood cell for a hematocrit of she also receive albumin of note the ct also do not reveal any evidence of acute bleed however this be a noncontrast study she be place on versed and propofol intubate in the unit with a fentanyl patch remain tachycardic the origin of which be unclear it be think initially that there be some type of narcotic control that may be responsible for this tachycardia however it be also speculate that she may be bleed from an unknown source she be intubate npo ng tube in place with iv fluid resuscitation foley in place per urology a note above on subq heparin with close monitoring of the hematocrit with transfusion to be give a necessary place on a triple regimen of clindamycin levo and flagyl on postoperative day the patient in the unit with hypertension anemia tachycardia the patient hematocrit be still and she receive additional unit of red blood

clonidine be add to her regimen as well a lopressor secondary to her tachycardia there be close examination of her mental status during this time on postoperative day the patient be still persistently tachycardic and hypertensive jp be discontinue on the day and in addition a note above haldol and clonidine be add to her regimen she continue to be agitate and there be a question raise then that there be an unclear history that be not previously diagnose of alcoholism and this may have be an alcohol withdrawal phenomenon so her versed actually be increase then for a questionable alcohol withdrawal and she be give multivitamin thiamine and folate and in addition for her hypertension lopressor be continue she be still intubate with goal of wean off ventilation npo ng tube to low suction the question of tpn be raise levo and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia which would be continue for day by postoperative day it be clear that this be a problem of drug or alcohol withdrawal at least that be what be think her neuro regimen be change at this time with various measure use verse then use ativan and apresodex to change her fentanyl regimen as well a add morphine to her regimen all with goal of increase the general relaxation psych be consult on postoperative day and conclude that this woman have a history of polysubstance abuse alcohol and likely opiate and chronic abdominal pain due to stricture which probably be relate to her opioid abuse i believe the delirium be likely multifactorial in etiology postoperative delirium that be notable for significant fluid shift there be the question of aspiration pneumonia in addition to possible opiate and alcohol withdrawal they recommend start with zyprexa if the patient be sedate in the with a dc dose of zyprexa and just use it in the evening and agree to taper off the versed minimize the use of opiate a tolerate by the patient and encourage the family to reorient the patient to keep her awake during the day on postoperative day her mental status be gradually clear patient goal be to wean off sedation for a possible extubation her blood pressure as well a heart rate be stabilize and tube feed be also start at this point with multivitamin and mineral replacement in addition urine output continue to be good her hematocrit be stable her culture be at this point negative but the antibiotic regimen be continue of note her stoma would gradually start to produce fluid and her incision during this leg of her course remain clean dry and intact on postoperative day she be also consult by addiction psychiatry who conclude similar result to recommendation conclude earlier they would agree with the zyprexa and also recommend restart ativan a i say additionally agree with the taper off of the verse with the use of ativan only for case of agitation and additionally recommend to the discontinue the celexa and buspar the patient be on until the delirium clear to avoid a polypharmacy of note psyche be able to speak with the husband who confirm the patient longstanding history of alcohol dependence that likely predate the year that he have know her it be important to note that the patient be consume approximately a quart of vodka a day as well a peppermint schnapps daily up until her surgery last april after that procedure she continue to drink presumably about beer a day however the husband since he be work so much be unable to really adequately guage just how much alcohol she be drink in addition she be note to have this be per the husband undergone multiple detox at treatment facility for alcohol dependence and believe that she have experience withdrawal seizure in the past on postoperative day the patient mental status be gradually improve with wean off of her versed with iv ativan and low dos a tolerated and she in addition this day be tolerate her tube feed however she do pull her ng tube again her foley be take out at this time the ureteral injury believe to be

the afternoon of of july the patient oxygen saturation suddenly drop she complain of feel short of breath and nauseous her room air saturation be when these symptom first develop over the next minute the patient decompensated and her oxygenation be steadily increase however on nonrebreather face mask her oxygen saturation be less than and her skin appear mottle a portable chest show mild congestive heart failure the patient ekg show a normal sinus rhythm no axis change and no st change the patient have receive mg of iv compazine for nausea otherwise no new medication since admission her temperature be at because of her rapid decompensation a code green be call and she be intubate and transfer to the micu abg show a ph of a of and a of follow intubation blood pressure remain during this time at to over to with heartrates in the to during her rapid decompensation the patient be give nebulizer but with no effect the cause of the patient sudden decompensation be unclear during the period of rapid decompensation the patient get a total of mg of iv lasix her lung exam show some crackle but she do not appear to be all that wet a chest three hour post intubation show diffuse fluffy infiltrates in the bilateral lung field more central than peripheral no effusion be note base on the finding of this chest a vq scan be not do it be think that the rapid decompensation be due to either pulmonary edema the patient have be on cc an hour of iv fluid for approximately hour because she be dehydrate when she first come in blood or pneumonia the patient be cover with vancomycin ceftazidime for pseudomonas levofloxacin for legionella and pentamidine for pcp the patient be also give mg of iv numerous laboratory study be send off include rsv influenza parainfluenza vre legionella pcp adenovirus bacillus and ana all of which be negative urine and blood culture be negative as well cardiogenic pulmonary edema be think to be an unlikely cause give that she have a normal left ventricular size and an ejection fraction of in an echocardiogram do right after be intubate there be also no evidence of any right ventricular dysfunction or rv strain she do well over the two day follow intubation and be extubated on of may a bronchoscopy be consider give the patient history of hemoptysis but a the hemoptysis resolve over the next couple of day it be think to be unnecessary the patient oxygen saturation follow extubation be on three liter nasal cannula and continue to be in the mid once she be wean to room air in the subsequent two day all antibiotic be stop while the patient be in the micu except for levofloxacin which be continue for a seven to ten day course the patient be gradually taper off of the iv and put on a prednisone taper start at mg q day the pulmonary consult team saw her when she be back on the floor for her continued hemoptysis but this appear to resolve over the next couple of day and a a result it be decide that this need not be pursue at the present the patient do well over the next several day and the day prior to discharge be saturate at on room air and receive mg of prednisone the etiology of the patient sudden decompensation be never entirely clarify but it appear that flash pulmonary edema be probably the most likely explanation possibly due to a viral pneumonia in conjunction with fluid overload

be up and down depend on the timing of her dialysis however she be relatively anuric but occasionally produce small volume of urine and this should be follow carefully as well she be continue on prednisone and azathioprine for her transplant and she do have one positive ua but this be not be treat because it be difficult to assess secondary to her extremely concentrated urine but should be

platelet seem to have stabilize in the high mid and she be not show any sign of acute bleed but this have be communicate with electrophysiology service who be aware of the possibility that amiodarone may be cause her thrombocytopenia and the amiodarone have be continue unless her thrombocytopenia worsen significantly she be also on a number of other medication that may cause thrombocytopenia and these will be follow a well however it be only the amiodarone for which the timing be coincident with the drop in her platelet pulmonary wenrich have a large right pleural effusion it be tap on cc be

develop a small hydropneumothorax this should be follow she also have a ct subsequently to rule out hemothorax and there be no evidence of that the pleural effusion be evident on her chest with underlying consolidation there have be no compromise however in her apparent pulmonary status and this should be follow since it will likely reaccumulate after tap but if she become more symptomatic it should be tap delperdang be on prednisone for her diabetes she be on nph and an insulin slide scale she experience an increase in her lfts her transaminase bump to several and her total bilirubin

her hematocrit steadily decrease from to and then increase she have an increase in her ldh but no schistocytes be notable on smear nevertheless she be think to be hemolyzing and receive a total of unit of packed red blood cell give in dos of unit each over the course of this hospitalization she be transfuse successfully without any complication or transfusion reaction and her hematocrit at the time of discharge be pulmonary the patient prednisone taper be discontinue on day because of oral candidiasis she be continue on neb however for intermittent wheeze she have have no acute copd exacerbation but have have increase shortness of breath periodically which have be improve with nebulizer treatment chest on demonstrate a small bilateral effusion she be think to be fluid overload at this time so her lasix be restart for diuresis also of note the patient have pain in the left posterior lower lung field which be pleuritic in nature she have lenis do which be negative have a pe protocol ct on which be negative at that time she be diuresed and her pleuritic left lower lobe chest pain resolve with diuresis she have a recurrence of this pain day prior to discharge after receive unit of packed red blood cell which presumably lead to a volume overload situation however once again after diuresis she have complete resolution of her symptom at this time the ct scan be review to ensure that there be no fracture of the rib a she do have tenderness in the left lower lung field area however the rib be visualize well and there be no evidence of any fracture cardiovascular the patient be continue on toprol and her diovan be hold secondary to elevated potassium she have intermittent chest pain without ekg change possibly secondary to esophageal spasm which be relieve by nitroglycerine her enzyme be negative for the first episode her troponin be on random draw this be likely a false positive and her enzyme thereafter be negative she have a preoperative mibi on which demonstrate a moderate area of reversible ischemia in the territory of the right coronary artery the decision be make however to go ahead with the surgery for her foot with spinal block not with general anesthesia her toprol be increase to mg give her mibi finding her goal heart rate be set for the and a statin be also added to her regimen it be felt that the cardiovascular plan in term of her coronary artery disease should be to increase her exercise tolerance during rehab to the point where she may begin to experience symptom and then cap at that time can be consider towards the end of the patient hospitalization she require diuresis particularly after receive bolus of volume with her blood transfusion it be note that when her volume status go up she have an increase in swell of her low extremity bilaterally as well a recurrence of her back pain in the area of the left lower lung field however as note before these improve with diuresis renal her baseline creatinine be to increase on this admission likely due secondary to the dye load which she receive prior to scan her creatinine peak at with the iv bactrim but begin to trend down after the iv bactrim be discontinue other reason for which her creatinine likely increase during this admission be secondary to her dopthromycin and also secondary to the iv bactrim endocrine the patient blood sugar have be well control after her prednisone be discontinue and she be maintain on a regimen of nph ophthalmology the ophthalmology team be consult for a new left floater the patient have a history of vitreous hemorrhage and questionable retinal detachment in the past the optic examination be notable for vitreous bleed in response to this the head of the patient bed be elevate and her symptom be stable thereafter if she have a recurrence of curtain symptom or spot or flash it be recommend that ophthalmology be reconsulted at that time gi the patient have complain of right upper quadrant pain during this admission her liver function test be elevate when initially check it be recommend by infectious disease since these would be monitor with iv bactrim they have be trend down since she be status post cholecystectomy and be initially very tender in her right upper quadrant her right upper quadrant ultrasound on be negative except for an enlarged liver alkaline phosphatase that be think to be secondary to

age with twin postoperative diagnosis be list a chorioamnionitis diabetes and demise of twin the finding be consistent with a live bear male infant apgars and a stillborn male infant apgars and and intact placenta and a amniotic fluid with light meconium in twin there be no complication her postpartum course be highly complicate by several issue that will be deal with by system in short she suffer a vfib arrest in the setting of the dic potential sepsis potential hellp syndrome and be admit to the medical intensive care unit and intubate ultimately she be discharge from the medical intensive care unit and be monitor on the labor floor and then be transfer to postpartum where she continue to recover and regain function until postoperative day when she be discharge home with vna in stable condition her issue will be deal with by system cardiology within hour follow her for stat cesarean section she present with acute onset of shortness of breath chest discomfort in the setting of a postpartum hemorrhage telemetry be apply and have evidence of widen qrs complex and ultimately she go into vfib arrest with pulseless electrical activity she underwent aggressive resuscitation in the form of shock with epinephrine follow the code blue she be bring back to the operating room where revealed potassium of which may have be the etiology of this vfib arrest a pulse be obtain follow the shock and epinephrine and she be intubate to clear her airway she be then transfer to the medical intensive care unit where cardiac enzyme be follow for total set and be find to be grossly positive the impression of her positive cardiac enzyme that do trend downwords be that it be secondary to the aggressive chest compression and be felt not likely to lead to significant myocardial injury an echocardiogram that be obtain on postoperative day while she be admit to the medical intensive care unit reveal no evidence of focal wall motion abnormality and show that the overall leave ventricular function be normal with an ef of of note throughout her micu admission she be tachycardic to to and this be ascribe to her marked amount of postpartum hemorrhage in the setting of possible chorioamnionitis with sepsis this tachycardia resolve by postoperative day and by postoperative day she be no long tachycardia with a heart rate in the her blood pressure while in the initial postpartum period be maintain in the normal range begin to become elevate by postoperative day and she be start on postoperative day on her labetalol mg this control her hypertension throughout the remainder of her hospital course and she be discharge home on labetalol hematology follow her stat cesarean section she undergo a postpartum hemorrhage with an estimated hemorrhage of l of blood from her vagina this dissection itself have only cc blood loss at this time her fibrinogen be appreciate to be and her coags be markedly elevate in the setting of dic she undergo an aggressive product resuscitation and ultimately she receive unit of packed red blood cell unit of fresh frozen plasma pool of platelet mcg of activated factor unit of cryoprecipitate unit of albumin and bag of hespan within a timeframe of to hour with this aggressive resuscitation her hematocrit drop to as low a but we within hour have increase to acutely follow this episode after her aggressive resuscitation her fibrinogen increase from it low of to her dic continue to be even after be discharge from the medical intensive care unit for this reason she be monitor on the labor floor for an additional day postoperative day and her coagulation study range from an inr of to when she be admit to postpartum her inr be and the day before discharge from the hospital her coagulation study be find to be normal with an inr of and fibrinogen of her platelet become an area of concern when she present with a platelet level that be find to be fluctuate between and in the initial presentation after her postpartum hemorrhage her platelet while in the medical intensive care unit go to as low a and this be felt to be possibly a component of her hellp syndrome versus dilution from her blood product resuscitation also part of her dic consumptive coagulopathy although her dic consumptive coagulopathy have evidence that it have resolve her platelet remain low and reach another low postoperative when they become a hematology consult be obtain to evaluate the possible cause of her low platelet and she undergo an extensive evaluation include a negative anticardiolipin and a negative lupus anticoagulant the impression be one of low platelet secondary to shock liver in addition to dic in addition to dilution with marked amount of blood product especially in the setting of the hematocrit range from the to range at that time her platelet continue to improve throughout the hospital course and her platelet upon discharge be and have trend up from the low of her hematocrit initially be find to be very high upon presentation at this be consistent with hemoconcentration with a trough to as low a while in the medical intensive care unit follow her resuscitation it go to as high a on postoperative day however it drop from to and then drop again to upon repeat check this be of concern but subsequent hematocrit be stable in the range her final hematocrit on the day of discharge be this drop hematocrit be discover in the setting of a rectus muscle hematoma that will be deal with elsewhere in the dictation but her hematocrit be stable upon discharge gi upon presentation neeb have evidence of increase lfts while in the medical intensive care unit she be find to have an ast of alt of and total bilirubin of these elevate liver enzyme in the setting of her low platelet be suspicious for possible hellp syndrome these lfts continue to improve with the ast and alt drop down to the normal limit upon discharge she be appreciate to have an alt of and ast of her bilirubin however continue to increase from to as high a in the setting of her increase bilirubin while the other lfts continue to improve a gi consul be obtain and she undergo a right upper quadrant ultrasound two time once while on the labor floor and once while on the postpartum floor both of these reveal a normal liver normal biliary tree as well a spleen in the setting of a normal nonobstructive picture the gi consult have the impression that the increased bilirubin be secondary to her shock liver as well a the multiple blood transfusion and possible sepsis they be confident that this would continue to improve but would likely take to week upon discharge her total bilirubin have begin to decrease to she do manifest evidence of jaundice that be improve through the hospital course on postoperative day culp develop a marked increase in her amylase and lipase this be check in the setting of increase right upper quadrant pain that ultimately resolve her lipase be elevate to as high a to gi be again reconsulted and have the impression that she do not suffer from pancreatitis give that she have no nausea or vomiting be tolerate a regular diet and have resolve abdominal pain they felt that this be likely secondary to change and be not an aggressive process that may need further treatment an abdominal pelvic ct also demonstrate a normal pancreas without any evidence of strand or pseudocyst formation the overall impression of the obstetrics team be that her constellation of dic associate with hyperbilirubinemia and low platelet be all consistent with a potential diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy this diagnosis be one that can be best make by a liver biopsy and discussion with the gi service reveal that they do not feel strongly that she need a liver biopsy the gi service be skeptical with regard to the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy despite the clinical hallmark be manifest in this patient they felt a if her symptom could be adequately explain by the degree of shock liver and postpartum hemorrhage that she experience it be unclear a to whether or not she have acute fatty liver of pregnancy but give the risk of recurrence she will be counsel a an outpatient with regard to future pregnancy and management of these pregnancy give her history of potential acute fatty liver of pregnancy incision on postoperative day she develop a dark blood ooze from a portion on the right aspect of her pfannenstiel incision this be concern for a possible subcutaneous hematoma so an abdominopelvic ct be obtain on postoperative day that show evidence of an x cm right rectus hematoma that may have have an area of track through the fascia into the subcutaneous space it be felt that this could undergo dress daily and would ultimately seal up and stop bleeding she be discharge home with vna daily dressing change and plan to reassess the incision at her followup postpartum appointment in day from the date of discharge of note this right rectus hematoma be diagnose in the setting of a drop in her hematocrit from to her hematocrit remain stable for additional day at infectious disease on postoperative day follow her

increase shortness of breath chill and diaphoresis and so he present to the emergency room in the emergency room he have a temperature of degree with room air oxygen saturation between and he be
