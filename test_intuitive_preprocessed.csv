morbid obesity and chronic episode of shortness of breath , this time accompany by jaw pain and with a history of coronary artery disease and multiple risk factor concern for acute coronary syndrome . the patient be initially treat for a possible ischemic event . diagnosis of pe result be consider . however , the patient be not tachycardic . she do not have any chest pain or new o2 requirement and have have several workups for pulmonary embolism during prior hospitalization with similar system , so therefore , this be think to be less likely . hospital course : by system : cardiac . in term of ischemia , the patient have 3 test of cardiac enzyme , which return negative . she be maintain on telemetry , and she have ekg check , which do not reveal any change . this be a patient who have a dobutamine mibi , which be negative for any evidence of ischemic change . during the mibi , there be no evidence of ischemia and/or scar . the patient be continue on her outpatient medication include aspirin , zocor , and atenolol . however , at a late point in her hospitalization , she become hypotensive at which time her atenolol be temporarily dc 'd , but this be restart prior to discharge . in term of the patient 's cardiac function , she have a history of chf and be on lasix a an outpatient . an echocardiogram be repeat during this hospitalization , which be notable for an ef of 60 % , trace-to-mild mr , moderate tr , and estimate pulmonary systolic pressure at 70 mmhg . the patient be continue on outpatient lasix regimen until at a late point during this hospitalization , the patient become hypertensive with acute renal failure at which time her lasix be discontinue . lasix be restart prior to discharge . in term of the patient 's rhythm , she have no evidence of arrhythmia monitor throughout her hospitalization . gi . on 10/10/2003 , the patient develop acute onset of diarrhea and low abdominal pain . now , this pain be nonradiating , alternate sharp and dull but constant , associate with nausea and vomiting , and frequent stool . at time , the stool be notable for bright red blood . the patient be therefore start on levofloxacin and flagyl a treatment for diverticulitis versus ischemic colitis . to further evaluate this , a ct scan of the abdomen be do , which be notable for a thickened colon for 10 cm at the hepatic flexure . give this information , it be the gi consult 's opinion that this be most likely consistent with diverticulitis , and the plan be to treat it aggressively with antibiotic , and once the symptom resolve , recommend a colonoscopy several week after discharge . the patient be continue on levofloxacin and flagyl , but then , several day later , become hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 80 . at this time , the patient 's antibiotic coverage be change to include ceptaz and vancomycin , and she also receive 1 dose of gentamicin . by the time of discharge , the patient 's abdominal symptom have completely resolve . she be no longer have any abdominal pain , and she need no longer have any diarrhea and be tolerate a regular diet without any difficulty . the plan be for her to have a followup colonoscopy a an outpatient . pulmonary : the patient be admit for shortness of breath . a differential diagnosis at that time include chronic pulmonary embolism versus cardiac etiology versus deconditioning in the setting of a chronic pulmonary fibrosis . to establish that the patient do not have any pe , she have low extremity doppler exam , which be negative . she also have a pt protocol ct , which be negative for any evidence of clot . because the patient do have cardiopulmonary hypertension , she be start on coumadin a prophylaxis for any thrombosis in the setting of her low flow in her pulmonary vasculature . throughout this hospitalization , she be continue on her own home regimen of o2 . renal : the patient have baseline chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine at 1.4 during this hospitalization at a time that her diarrhea be very severe , and when her blood pressure fell in the 80 , the patient develop acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 2.4 with decreased urine output . the thought of the team be that this represent a renal failure in the setting of her diarrhea , fluid loss , and hypertension . her pheno be consistent with this at 0.71. she be treat with aggressive iv fluid . she also have a renal ultrasound , which be normal . she do have 1 day of hematuria , which be think to be due most likely to foley trauma , which resolve at the time of discharge . id : the patient 's hospital course be notable for a diarrhea a mention in gi . she be initially treat with levofloxacin and flagyl and then when she become hypertensive be then change her flagyl , ceptaz , and vancomycin with 1 dose of gentamicin . her symptom dramatically improve on these antibiotic on 9/18 she be change from iv antibiotic to a p.o . regimen of flagyl and levofloxacin . the plan be for her to continue a total of 14 day of antibiotic . i anticipate the last day of antibiotic coverage will be 2/19/2003 . rheumatology : on 10/27/2003 , the patient be note to have leave knee pain and be note to have some focal lateral patellar tenderness and swell . a knee aspirate be perform and urate crystal be identify , and the patient be diagnose with gout . because of her chronic renal insufficiency and diarrhea , the decision be make to treat her gout flare with steroid , and she be currently be on a steroid taper a treatment . endocrine : the patient have a history of diabetes . she take 70/30 insulin at home . she be initially continue on an outpatient regimen ; however , when she start to begin have massive diarrhea , she be take off her long-acting insulin , because she be not take anything by p.o . at this time , she be not tolerate a regular diet , and her insulin requirement be increase . it be recommend that a an outpatient , she resume one-half of her regular outpatient insulin dose for 1 or 2 day to ensure that her insulin requirement in her diet be appropriate , and then , she should resume her regular insulin dosage . discharge medication : include aspirin 325 mg p.o . q.d . , atenolol 25 mg p.o . q.d . , lasix 60 mg p.o . b.i.d . , zoloft 50 mg p.o . q.d . , zocor 20 mg p.o . q.h.s . , neurontin 300 mg p.o . b.i.d . , levofloxacin 500 mg p.o . q.d . , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o . q.d . , prednisone taper - which involve 10 mg of prednisone on 8/14 follow by 5 mg of prednisone on 10/27 , 1/24 , and 3/1 and then stop , flagyl 500 mg p.o . t.i.d . , insulin 70/30 11 unit q.a.m . 13 unit q.p.m . - once it be establish that the patient have return to her regular diet , this dosage should be double to her outpatient regular dose , and flexeril 10 mg p.o . t.i.d . disposition : the patient have be discharge to a rehab facility . followup : the patient be to follow up with her primary care physician , dr. hargus follow discharge . additional instruction : antibiotic should be continue until 2/19/2003 . the patient should have her inr check in 3 day . her goal inr be 2. once off levofloxacin , her dose of coumadin may need to be adjust . 2. the patient should have an outpatient colonoscopy and treat for a week to further ass for diverticulitis . 3. fingerstick blood glucose should be follow regularly a the patient 's insulin dose be titrate up to her previous outpatient dose . escription document : 4-2417824 kffocus dictate by : okrent , reed booker attending : pegelow , lincoln allen dictation id

have tolerate this in april , which she be treat for a foot ulcer . it be not clear if this be a rash or it be think to be possibly relate to a fever that the patient have , but it be not clear what the actual reaction be . social history : the patient be an 80-pack-year smoker . he be currently smoke . physical exam on admission : her temperature be 99 , her pulse be 98 , her blood pressure be 105/55 . her respiratory rate be 18 when she be saturate 94 % on room air . in general , she be in no acute distress . her heent exam be unremarkable . her cardiac exam be regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex . her lung exam be notable for crackle most prominent in the left low lobe . her abdomen be soft , obese , nontender and nondistended with good bowel sound . her extremity be significant for erythema of the left shin without warmth or tenderness . she also have a small 1.5 cm ulceration on the bottom of her left foot which have be present for sometime although she say that it look good than at first . there be no purulence or purulent drainage from the wound . her neurologic exam be unremarkable . laboratory data on admission : her lab be notable for a creatinine of 1.6 , a white count of 4.1 , with 11 % eosinophil . her hematocrit be 31.6 , and her albumin be 3. procedure : cardiac catheterization : it be do by dr. eeds . finding : show a right dominant circulation . there be no significant leave main lesion identify . the lad have a tubular 90 % lesion and the diagonal i have a proximal tubular 60 % lesion , there be also a diffuse 80 % lesion of the proximal circumflex . the rca have a proximal 75 % lesion with a mid diffuse 60 % lesion and a plv tubular 70 % lesion . the coronary artery bypass graft have a patent lima to lad graft , the svg to marginal i have a 100 % lesion during this catheterization due to the moderate amount of contrast and the patient 's chronic kidney disease , they treat the rca and place a 3 x 24 mm taxus stent echocardiogram : on 7/9/07 , show an estimate ejection fraction of 50 % with inferoseptal and inferior severe hypokinesis . the rv be normal . there be mild aortic stenosis . mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation . the valve area be 1.2 cm2 . there be mild mitral regurgitation . there be trace tricuspid regurgitation with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 mm plus right atrial pressure . hospital course by problem : 1. cardiovascular : a. ischemia : the patient be admit because they have deep t wave inversion in the lateral lead and be still concern for anginal equivalence of nausea and vomiting . it be decide on admission that an echocardiogram would be perform and if there be evidence of any regional wall motion abnormality that she would be take directly to cath . the echocardiogram a note above show inferior hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery disease . she be take to the cath lab on 9/5/07 and they show two ____ that one of the bypass graft be completely occluded and be not visualize . they also saw that there be a proximal rca lesion 60 % which be find to account for the inferior hypokinesis give the right arm circulation . this be stented with a taxus stent . because of her kidney insufficiency , it be decide not to pursue the 80 % leave circ lesion and this be defer until later point a this be not think to be cause any problem . her post cath ecg be unchanged and continue to have the deep lateral t wave inversion . she do not complain of any chest pain or nausea and vomiting during her admission . she be start on aspirin and plavix initially although as note below she do have an apparent allergy to plavix and thus be switch to ticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d . instead of plavix for anticoagulation . she be also continue lipitor 80 mg daily , lopressor 25 mg t.i.d . after her cath , it be originally plan that she would go back to cath for intervention on the left circulation lesion , however , give her other medical problem and her relative stability hemodynamically and symptomatically , it be decide that they would wait and decide later if this lesion need to be correct in the future or not . b. pump : the patient have no significant issue with her blood pressure here . she remain in a blood pressure range of 100-120 throughout her stay . she be continue on her beta blocker a note above . however , at discharge , this be switch back to atenolol a her home medication and she refuse to change medication , she say that she would not be able to afford new prescription . we do increase her dose of atenolol to 25 mg b.i.d . from 25 mg daily a her requirement of beta blockade seem to be high than what her home dose be . give that she have a concurrent renal disease , it would probably be useful for her to be on an ace inhibitor arb as well . this medication should be add a an outpatient , if her blood pressure tolerate it . it be on the low side here , so we do not add it . we do not diurese her in fact we hold her lasix on admission because she seem to be volume deplete give that she be admit with a lot of diarrhea , this again will need to be reconsider if she have increase edema . this can be restart . c : rhythm : the patient be keep on telemetry , however , there be no significant episode of arrhythmia during her admission . 2. gi : the patient be admit with persistent nausea and diarrhea from tlmamuthes medical center . the diarrhea resolve one day after admission . her fecal leukocyte be positive but her c. diff be negative . it be unclear what the etiology of this diarrhea be and we be go to send a repeat stool study , however , she do not have any diarrhea afterwards and this may be antibiotic associated diarrhea but it seem to resolve spontaneously . 3. pulmonary : the patient be admit with crackle in the left low lobe and some wheezing consistent with copd and pneumonia . a chest x-ray on admission show a right low lobe infiltrate/atelectasis . we initially continue her on augmentin , which she be take for her diabetic foot ulcer . however , she do not appear to clinically respond to this medication . we hold her antibiotic a noted below in the id section and after that her white blood cell count increase and she produce some purulent sputum and gram-negative rod . the gram-negative rod be later speciate a serratia although this information be not available at the time of her discharge . she be treat for a hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftazidime to complete a 14-day course . clinically , she appear to improve on this regimen , although her white count be still elevate at 15 on discharge , however , give her overall clinical stability , the lack of fever and the lack of systemic symptom . we felt comfortable with discharge her with close follow up . 4. infectious disease : the patient be initially admit on augmentin for a diabetic foot ulcer , the note from grantnas healthcare by the infectious disease service recommend a 2-4 week course of augmentin for her diabetic foot ulcer . she have complete three week of therapy and thus we discontinue this medication a it do not seem that there be really any evidence of active infection in her foot . after hold the antibiotic for three day , her white count begin to rise and she develop a purulent cough a note above , this be think to be a hospital-acquired pneumonia . she be treat with vancomycin and ceftazidime and she will complete a 14-day course of these antibiotic . 5. endocrine : the patient be home on oral hypoglycemics . she be switch to coverage with an insulin scale . her sugar be relatively well control and she do not require much in the way of supplemental insulin . 6. renal : the patient have chronic kidney disease . her baseline creatinine be 1.5-1.6. she be admit and have a cath . she be give mucomyst and bicarbonated fluid for renal protection during her dilute . because of the risk for kidney , the cath be do with a little amount of dye a possible . her creatinine remain stable throughout her admission and settle out at 1.6 of her creatinine which be the baseline . allergy : during the patient 's admission , it be note that she develop a rash on 4/15/06 . she be see by the allergy and immunology service at the request of the cath lab give that there be concern that she have this rash because of her plavix . they felt that this be possible . this be the most likely etiology and in conjunction with her high eosinophil count it be felt that this be a drug reaction to the plavix . she be switch to ticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d . and her rash appear to improve . she be also give claritin as well a put on a brief prednisone taper give her diffuse rash and her brisk eosinophilia . she should follow up with allergy and immunology in about one month to see if the rash have resolve and potentially to try rechallenge with plavix at that point . cellulitis/diabetic foot ulcer : the patient have have a longstanding diabetic foot ulcer which have be treat by wound care vna and be treat at tha hospital . we continue the augmentin to a total course of three week and then stop it . we continue her dress change and this will be follow by the vna at home . there be no evidence of active infection , there be no purulence or erythema around the area of the ulcer and the erythema around the foot appear to be stable , this be most likely chronic venous stasis change and not a true cellulitis a there be no warmth or tenderness in this region . consultant : allergy/immunology , the attending be dr. frija . physical exam at discharge : the patient be afebrile . her pulse be 86 , her blood pressure be 120/60 , her respiratory rate be 20. she be 92-96 % on room air . in general , she be in no acute distress . her jvp be about 7 cm . she have small amount of crackle at bilateral base . her cardiac exam be regular rate and rhythm with normal s1 and s2 . there be a 2/6 systolic murmur most prominent at the left lower sternal border . her abdomen be soft , nontender , and nondistended with good bowel sound . she have 1+ edema bilaterally with small amount of erythema at the distal end of the left low extremity which have be stable . there be no associated warmth or tenderness . she do have a 1.5 cm small ulcer on the ventral aspect of her left foot , which do not have any purulence associate with it . her neurologic exam be nonfocal . laboratory data on admission : notable for a creatinine of 1.5 , a white blood cell count of 15.89 , with 82.7 % neutrophil , 3.8 % eosinophil . her hematocrit be 28.6. her baseline appear to be around 30. discharge medication : 1. ticlopidine 250 mg by mouth twice a day . 2. atenolol 25 mg by mouth b.i.d . 3. lipitor 80 mg daily . 4. prednisone taper 30 mg on 10/18/07 , 20 mg on 10/3/07 , 10 mg on 10/18/07 and then stop . 5. vancomycin 1 g iv daily , course to be complete on 1/16/07 . 6. ceftazidime 1 g daily to be complete on 1/16/07 . 7. allopurinol 100 mg daily . 8. neurontin 300 mg three time a day . 9. tessalon perles a need . 10. ativan 0.5 mg at bedtime a need for sleep . 11. glipizide 2.5 mg daily . 12. duoneb every 4 hour a need for shortness of breath . 13. lasix 30 mg by mouth daily . 14. aspirin 81 mg daily . disposition : home with service . pending test : a note , the patient have a sputum culture that be grow gram-negative rod at the time of discharge . the current report be that it be grow serratia marcescens which should be staph sensitive to ceftazidime , which he be prescribe for a total of 14 day . follow up : she will follow up with dr. antony baldonado on 10/12/07 at 9:30 a.m. she have an appointment schedule . to do list : 1. the patient have an 80 % leave circumflex lesion which be not

admission ) , right leg numbness and weakness , right arm clumsiness follow by dysarthria . hospital course by system : 1. neurology : the patient be felt to have a probable subcortical stroke of the left hemisphere with preservation of the speech processing ability with dense motor and sensory involvement . this be felt to potentially represent an mca branch occlusion with increased edema versus a large lacuna . in addition , give her history , the team be unable to rule out the possibility of an embolic event . therefore , the patient be admit and rule out for a myocardial infarction . her cks be 25 , 37 , 37 and 32. she be place on a cardiac monitor with no evidence of arrhythmia . she be place on subcu heparin and start on full dose aspirin 325 milligram p.o . q.d . in order to far work up the etiology for stroke , the patient have an echocardiogram do which reveal evidence of concentric lvh with preserved systolic function , calculate ejection fraction of 55 % . other than nonspecific septal abnormality , there be no evidence of regional wall motion dysfunction . there be early change of mitral annular calcification present , some increase excursion of the mitral leaflet , but this be associate with only trivial regurgitation . trileaflet aortic valve without dysfunction . one plus tricuspid regurgitation . peak doppler flow velocity across the tricuspid valve reach 2.5 meter per second consistent with normal right heart systolic pressure . there be no evidence of effusion . in addition , the patient underwent carotid noninvasive study which reveal no evidence of hemodynamically significant disease in either carotid artery with those artery have minimal plaque and 1-25 % stenosis . in addition , the patient have an mri/mra to further evaluate potential lesion . on mri there be a focal area of increase t2 signal in the posterior limb of the left internal capsule , close the genu . this area demonstrate restricted diffusion on epi diffusion , weight sequence . a similar small area of signal abnormality be note in the left globus pallidus adjacent to the leave internal capsule abnormality . these area represent subacute infarction . the ventricle and sulcus be minimally prominent , consistent with the patient 's age . there be no other signal abnormality note . major vascular flow void be normal . there be no mass or mass effect . three d , tof mrn angiogram on the circle of willis and it major tributary do not demonstrate any abnormality . incidental note be make of a dominant right vertebral artery . the formal impression reveal subacute infarct involve the posterior limb of the internal capsule on the left as well a the left globus pallidus . unremarkable mr angiogram on the circle of willis . in addition , give the patient 's history of polymyalgias , an esr and c-reactive protein be obtain . the esr be 46. the c-reactive protein be 1.13. the stroke service be ask to comment on the possibility of a vasculitic process . in addition , the patient 's primary rheumatologist be consult as well . the patient 's primary rheumatologist felt that the patient 's stroke be most likely due to small vessel disease associate with diabetes and hypertension . he felt there be no evidence for a vasculitis . he therefore suggest to continue aspirin , but in high dos to alleviate her left shoulder pain . the patient do not feel that she have any vasculitic process . they therefore recommend continue aspirin 325 milligram p.o . q.d . , check a serum homocystine which remain pending at the time of this dictation , review her carotid study ( mention above ) , and continue with physical therapy occupational therapy and speech therapy . pt and ot be consult as well a speech therapy . in addition to continue the patient on aspirin , continue subcu heparin while the patient be immobile , the patient's antihypertensive be hold in order to maintain a systolic blood pressure between 140-160 and a diastolic blood pressure between 85-90 for the first ten day follow her stroke . for the first few day , the patient be keep in a lying position as much a possible and her activity level be gradually increase to the point where she be participate in full pt/ot . at the time of this dictation , the patient 's norvasc continue to be hold with excellent control of her blood pressure between systolic of 140-160. it should not be reinitiated until roughly ten day after her stroke . the patient have relatively poor return of function during her hospital stay , but be felt to be a good candidate for potential rehabilitation . therefore when her medical issue be stable , she be consider ready for transfer to a rehabilitation facility in an attempt to far improve her neurologic function . a noted previously , the patient 's antihypertensive should be reinitiated gradually with a goal systolic blood pressure between 140-160 with a diastolic blood pressure of 85-90 to be initiate roughly ten day from the time of her stroke ( present on 8/17/98 ) . a note by the work up , the patient have no evidence of an embolic source for her stroke and her carotid study be unremarkable . 2. rheumatologic : a note , the patient have a long history of diffuse arthritic complaint . she have her sed rate and c-reactive protein check . rheumatology be consult who felt that her stroke be not consistent with a vascular process . they do recommend check a urinalysis to check for red blood cell and cast . her urinalysis show no protein , no blood , 0-2 red blood cell , no cast . only other recommendation be to continue aspirin and consider high dos to alleviate left shoulder pain . in addition , recommend avoid nonsteroidal while the patient be on aspirin . 3. endocrine : the patient have a history of diabetes mellitus and have not take her insulin for several day prior to admission . the patient be place on her regular insulin schedule as well a a slide scale . the patient 's blood sugar have range from the 150 to the high 200s . a the patient 's diet return to baseline , she may require adjustment of her nph and regular insulin dos . in addition , the patient 's premarin be hold during this admission and further therapy should be decide by the patient 's follow up neurologist . 4. fluid , electrolyte and nutrition : the patient initially appear somewhat dehydrate on admission and be therefore rehydrated with iv fluid . she have good resolution and return to baseline of her bun and creatinine . she be eat well at the time of discharge . close observation be pay to her electrolyte include her potassium . her electrolyte should be periodically monitor at least once a week at rehabilitation . she do have a history of hyperkalemia and should be watch carefully for this . 5. social work : the patient initially make a comment to the medical team that she have be abuse by her husband . the social worker be consult and ask to see her regard this issue of spouse abuse . it be true that her husband have hit her in the forehead with a baseball bat in the past . he die several year ago and no further abuse history could be elicit since his death . she currently have two supportive child . the patient be consider stable and ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility . when the date of her transfer be make available , her discharge medication will be dictate along with

have several uncle and cousin with cancer , but she be unsure of what type . social history : the patient live with her daughter and grandson . she have no history of tobacco or alcohol use . physical examination : vital sign : temperature 97.9 , pulse 101 , bp 80/66 , respiratory rate 16 , o2 sit 99 % on room air . general : alert , spanish-speaking , no acute distress . heent : perrl , eomi , poor dentition , op clear . neck : no lad , from , supple . chest : ctab . cv : irregularly irregular , s1 , s2 , no murmurs/rubs/gallops . abdomen : soft , distend , mild tenderness to palpation in the low quadrant bilaterally , slightly tympanitic , normoactive bowel sound , no hepatosplenomegaly . extremity : warm/well perfuse , trace dp/pt pulse , no clubbing/cyanosis/edema , ulcer on left large toe , severely cracked and dry skin on hand and foot . neuro : cranial nerve ii through xii grossly intact , 5/5 strength throughout . laboratory value : significant for creatinine 1.3 , glucose 137 , wbc 9.6 with 28 polys and 29 band , hematocrit 38.1 , total protein 5.2 , albumin 2.0 , alt 41 , ast 18 , alk phos 61 , total bilirubin 2.5. an ekg show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at approximately 140 beats/minute . no st or t wave change . hospital course : 1. gi : colitis : give the patient 's persistent and chronic nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea , there be significant concern for small bowel obstruction on admission . however , a kub and abdominal ct be both negative for small bowel obstruction . she be originally keep n.p.o . for bowel rest , and a nasogastric tube be place with significant drainage . stool study be send include c. difficile , ovum and parasite , cecal leukocyte , and shigella/salmonella/yersinia/campylobacter study , all of which be negative . because of the concern nature of the patient's symptom , surgery consult be call , however they felt that her problem be likely nonsurgical in nature . ct perform two day and five day after admission show identical finding of right-sided colitis . they remain largely unchanged . nevertheless , the patient experience continued nausea and vomiting and also continue diarrhea throughout this time . once her nasogastric tube output decrease significantly , approximately one week after admission , the tube be remove and the patient be start on p.o . , and her diet be advance a tolerate . from that point on , the patient have no nausea or vomiting , and she be currently tolerate a full diet . nevertheless , she continue to have mild diarrhea , now two episode per day a compare to6 to 8 episode per day prior to admission . in the end , the workup for the underlying cause of her nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea have be negative . it be therefore our suspicion that her symptom be most likely secondary to toxicity from her chemotherapy medication , xeloda . of note , the patient also have other sign of xeloda toxicity , include possible hepatotoxicity ( see below ) as well a severe cracking and drying of the skin on her hand and foot . 2. hepatitis : a ct perform on admission to evaluate for small bowel obstruction show a significantly cirrhotic and fatty liver with no mass . on admission , the patient 's total bilirubin be 2.5 ; however , her bilirubin level escalate precipitously to a maximum of 17.6. at the same time , the patient develop clinical manifestation of this , include scleral icterus and jaundice . also , a her albumin level decrease to below 1.5 , she develop significant ascites and peripheral edema . gastroenterology consult suggest a right upper quadrant ultrasound , which be negative for obstruction , a hepatic mri , which also show a cirrhotic and fatty liver , and also a diagnostic/therapeutic ir guide paracentesis , which drain 1 liter of sterile fluid . hepatitis serology be also send , and the patient be hepatitis a and b negative , but c positive ; however , her viral load be less than assay , and her afp be within normal limit . a rheumatologic workup for autoimmune hepatitis be also negative . because of the acuteness and the timing of her presentation , it be felt that her liver failure be likely secondary to a combination of hepatitis and also toxicity from her xeloda . on discharge , the patient 's hepatic function have be improve significantly for three day , with her albumin increasing , her inr decreasing and her bilirubin level also decrease . on discharge , her total bilirubin be 16.0 down from 17.6 , her albumin be 1.9 up from 1.5 , and her inr be 1.6 down from 2.6. it be anticipate that a the patient 's nutritional status continue to improve , her hepatic function will continue to normalize with result normalization of her laboratory value . 3. cardiovascular : on admission , the patient be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at the rate of approximately 140 beat per minute . she be also hypotensive , with a blood pressure of roughly 90/60 . she be place on cardiac telemetry , which record rapid a. fib . up to the 170s . a a result , she be give iv lopressor with decreased heart rate but also significant reduction in her blood pressure require fluid bolus . after 24 hour , after her blood pressure have stabilize follow the administration of intravenous fluid , she be start on a diltiazem drip at 5 mg per hour , which help to establish stable rate control in the 80 with continued atrial fibrillation . at the same time , the patient be load with digoxin , but her level be high ; give that the patient be status post a recent admission for digoxin toxicity , this medication be subsequently hold . in one incident , the patient develop a temporary junctional rhythm for approximately 5 minute with a heart rate in the 50 . at that point , input be elicit from the cardiology consult service , who think that her symptom be likely secondary to the diltiazem drip . however , give concern for a tachy-brady syndrome , the possibility of an implantable cardiac pacemaker be discuss . however , the patient do not have any recurrence of the junctional rhythm . a tte be obtain , which show an ejection fraction of 60 % with trace mr and moderate tr , leave and right atrial enlargement , and normal left and right ventricular function . once the patient be again take p.o . medication , her diltiazem drip be change to p.o . diltiazem . for the next several day , the patient have several episode each night of 3 to 5 beat run of nsvt . however , on the three day prior to discharge , the patient have no event on telemetry , and her heart rate be stable in the 60 to 80 , with a blood pressure run from 90-100/50-60 . shortly before discharge , the patient also develop episodic shortness of breath , which be attribute to mild pulmonary edema , and she respond well to bolus of iv lasix . a a result , she be restart on aldactone with effective gentle diuresis . the plan on discharge will be to follow her volume status carefully and to adjust her diuretic regimen a need to maintain her volume status with continued improvement in her hepatic function . 4. endocrine : the patient have a history of diabetes mellitus , and her metformin be hold on admission secondary to an elevated creatinine . a a result , she be start on a lispro slide scale . give that she be n.p.o . for several day , she be not give any insulin and her blood sugar remain stable in the low 100 . after she again start take p.o . , she be restart on a slide scale , and she maintain excellent blood sugar control between 100 and 150. a hemoglobin a1c obtain during this admission be also within normal limit . of note , the patient have a leave toe ulcer , and be see by orthopedic surgery and outpatient totally before admission . 5. heme : the patient have an inr of 2.6 on admission secondary to cirrhosis and poor nutrition . a a result , she be give vitamin k subcu n.p.o . a needed . a noted above , despite a history of atrial fibrillation , the patient be not on coumadin at home secondary to poor med compliance . at home , she be only on aspirin , but this be also discontinue during the admission secondary to continue guaiac positive stool . nevertheless , her hematocrit remain stable throughout her admission and she do not require any transfusion . a dvt prophylaxis , the patient be keep on pneumo boot throughout the admission . at one point , she be note to have leave upper extremity swell great than the right upper extremity , but an ultrasound be negative for dvt . a noted above , on discharge , the patient 's inr be improve secondary to improve nutrition . she will be discharge without any anticoagulation at present , however this can be far reevaluate a an outpatient by her cardiologist and oncologist . 6. fen : the patient be initially rehydrated with normal saline , however this be change to d5w plus 3 amp of bicarb since she develop a bicarb gap . once this gap be close , she be give gentle normal saline a maintenance fluid . once the patient start take significant p.o . , her iv fluid be discontinue . the patient 's electrolyte be also replete a necessary . plan on discharge will be to continue follow her electrolyte closely to prevent further exacerbation of her cardiac arrhythmia . 7. pain : the patient be give oxycodone p.o . and morphine iv for pain . the patient be previously on vioxx at home for orthopedic pain related to her diabetes , however , give recent data suggest possible cardiotoxic effect of vioxx , this will be discontinue , and she will be send home with oxycodone p.r.n . for pain . 8. onc : the patient 's xeloda be currently on hold since many of her symptom lead up to this admission be likely secondary to chemo toxicity . a noted above , the patient have other evidence of chemo toxicity as well , include significantly dry skin on her hand and foot . the patient 's outpatient oncologist , dr. willard brixius , follow her closely during this admission , and she will follow up with the patient regard possible change to her chemotherapy regimen . 9. disposition : the patient be see by the physical therapy service shortly before discharge , and they note that she display difficulty even move from the bed to the chair , which be significantly below her baseline of be able to ambulate independently . a a result , after extensive discussion with her family , it be decide that the patient will be best serve by go to a rehab facility for continue closed supervision of her medical problem , supervise administration of her medication regimen , continue strength training and conditioning , and also continue nutrition . once the patient be able to be less dependent on outside assistance , she can be send home with either a home health aide or visit nurse for continued rehabilitation . of note , the patient 's code status be establish by her outpatient oncologist a dnr/dni . this be confirm with the patient during this hospitalization . physical examination on discharge : vital sign : temperature 98.3 , pulse 80 , blood pressure 104/64 , respiratory rate 20 , o2 sit 99 % on room air . general : alert , no acute distress , icteric sclerae , and slightly jaundice . respiratory : ctab except for few crackle at the base bilaterally . cv : irregularly irregular s1 , s2 , 1/6 sm at the left upper sternal border , no rubs/gallops . abdomen :

: the patient will be discharge to rehabilitation facility , where she will continue to be give supportive care for ongoing symptom of her enteritis and hepatic failure . she will also receive physical therapy and nutrition to help her return to her baseline function . prior to discharge from rehab , her medication regimen should be simplify as much a possible to prevent future confusion over her medication , a have happen in the past . on discharge from rehab , the patient should be send home with either a visiting nurse or home health aide , a insurance permit . at that point , she will follow up with dr. snellbaker , her primary care physician ; dr. fushimi , her outpatient oncologist ; and dr. khalili , her outpatient cardiologist . escription document : 5-4163960 emssten tel

interval be normal . axis of 21 degree . leave atrial enlargement . no acute ischemic change . hospital course : ms. franz be initially admit with a diagnosis of left pleural effusion of unclear etiology . a left thoracentesis be perform and the fluid be deem exudative . it be bloody in appearance and have a white count great than 4 , 000 , with a red cell count great than 500 , 000. patient meet criterion for exudative fluid by fluid-serum-ldh ratio , fluid-serum-protein ratio and ldh great than 200. subsequent culture , however , be negative for a bacterial fungal afb . rheumatology etiology be also r/o with negative ana and negative rheumatoid factor . cytology be send on the patient , which also return negative for malignant cell . a total of 1.5 liter be drain from the thoracentesis . subsequent to the thoracentesis , the patient felt significantly well , with good exercise tolerance and less orthopnea . she remain with rao to sat great than 95 % for the remainder of her hospitalization and do not require oxygen . a repeat chest x-ray be do prior to discharge , and compare to post-thoracentesis , show no significant accumulation of the left pleural effusion . initially it be felt that the patient 's symptom might have some relationship to some element of congestive heart failure . she be start on digoxin and captopril and maxed at digoxin .25 q day and captopril 50 mg t.i.d . during this hospitalization , however , the patient note in passing , that she have , since her 6/28 surgery , develop significant dizziness and orthostatic symptom upon sit up and rise , and have limit exercise tolerance partly because of shortness of breath , but also partly because of her dizziness symptom . she note occasional vertigo and occasional diplopia . a work-up subsequently ensue relate to the symptom . neurology be consult and carotid doppler , as well a mra of the head to r/o vertebral basal insufficiency be perform . both carotid doppler reveal less than 25 stenosis bilaterally and mra of the head reveal no vertebral basal insufficiency . however , it be note on repeated measurement of the patient 's blood pressure , that when she sit up and when she stand up , she become hypotensive . a modified bruce protocol stress test be perform to determine the patient 's exercise tolerance . prior to initiation of the modified bruce , supine blood pressure be 120/80 . upon sit up , the patient 's blood pressure be 92 and upon begin the modified bruce within less than one minute , the patient 's blood pressure dip to 60 systolic , and test be terminate . an echocardiogram during this admission reveal an ejection fraction of 30 % , moderate lv dilatation , severe global hyperkinesis , preserve right ventricular function and size , and only trivial mr and tr . no significant arrhythmia be note on the patient's cardiac monitor throughout her hospitalization , except for one episode of transient third degree heart block with a ventricular rhythm . the patient do not demonstrate this rhythm consistently , however , during her hypertensive episode . on review of the patient 's past medical history , however , it be find that the patient have be on chronic steroid for two year prior to her 6/28 cabg and prior to the onset of these symptom of orthostasis and dizziness . patient note that she be more on than off on p.o . steroid for treatment of her shortness of breath at an outside hospital in perv rome voraso , nevada 15117 at that time , they have deem that her shortness of breath symptom be secondary to pulmonary etiology rather than cardiac . we , therefore , suspect adrenal insufficiency and consult endocrine . acth stem test be perform and cortisol , adolsterone and acth level be draw at 0:30 and 60 minute post-administration of acth . the patient develop hive and angioedema with the acth which be relieve with benadryl iv . after the performance of the acth stem test empirically start on hydrocortisone 80 mg iv . the next day the patient 's symptom resolve and she no longer have any evidence of orthostatic hypertension or dizziness symptom relate to stand or walk . repeat blood pressure measurement for orthostatic be unyielding . the patient note her symptom be completely resolve and that she felt like a different person . it be , therefore , felt that the empiric trial of hydrocortisone be significant and that the patient most likely have adrenal insufficiency secondary to chronic steroid for the two year prior to the 6/28 cabg , and this be consistent with the time closer to patient 's symptom , which begin after the 6/28 cabg when she be off steroid . the patient be therefore discharge in stable condition with diagnosis of a left pleural effusion secondary to most likely a post-pericardiotomy syndrome , as well a orthostatic hypertension and dizziness symptom secondary to adrenal insufficiency . at the time of discharge , the patient 's acth stem test be still pending , as well a the tsh . it be felt at the time of discharge , the patient should not be manage on captopril or digoxin . it remain unclear whether or not the patient 's current ejection fraction be adequate for her symptom . discharge medication : flexeril 10 mg p.o . b.i.d ; benadryl 50 mg p.o . b.i.d ; prednisone 20 mg p.o . b.i.d ; prozac 20 mg p.o . qd ; synthroid 50 mcg p.o . qd ; mevacor 20 mg p.o . qd ; quinaam 325

notable for a father with diabetes and a brother with heart disease . summary of the hospital course : 1. shortness of breath : the patient initially present with shortness of breath , saturate 77 % on room air . he be note on chest x-ray to have moderate bilateral effusion . the effusion be likely secondary to congestive heart failure , although pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion could not be exclude . give that he be afebrile with a decrease white count and not increasingly hypoxic , parapneumonic effusion be consider less likely compare to worsen chf . give the concern for chf , he be give lasix 40 mg iv approximately one to two dos a day for large volume diuresis , with a goal of total body balance of 2 liter negative per day . over the course of his hospitalization , his bilateral effusion improve , although there be small effusion note on the chest x-ray at the time of discharge . his oxygen requirement decrease , and on the day of discharge , he be saturate 97-98 % on 1 liter . of note , the patient be bring to ultrasound for a plan guided thoracocentesis , but the effusion site be small such that in the context of this clinical improvement , thoracocentesis be defer . he be maintain initially as well with vancomycin and levofloxacin , although the vancomycin be discontinue after four day , and the levofloxacin be discontinue on discharge ( of note , he receive 10 day total of levofloxacin start from 3/27/2006 at his nursing home ) . echocardiogram note an ejection fraction of 55-60 % with left ventricular hypertrophy , consistent with diastolic dysfunction . the etiology of his congestive heart failure and pleural effusion be therefore think to be atrial fibrillation with rvr . in term of follow up , he need daily weight ; if he gain great than 2 pound over 24 hour , it be recommend that his lasix dose be double for that day . a a discharge , he be be send out on lasix 40 mg p.o . daily . 2. cardiovascular : a. ischemia : the patient initially have a small troponin leak 0.32 , which be think secondary to demand ischemia from atrial fibrillation with rvr . for this , he be briefly start on a heparin drip . subsequently , cardiac enzymes trend down . the patient be maintain on coumadin and aspirin 81 mg , along with zocor and questran for hyperlipidemia . on hospital day # 3 to # 4 , telemetry note pause . ekg show in addition to pausing , new t-wave inversion in anterior precordial lead , associate with st depression . this be think to be either due to ischemia or digitalis toxicity . his digoxin level measure 1.3 to 1.4 , so digoxin be hold , with improve in pausing , but no change in t-wave inversion . in discussion with his outpatient cardiologist , it be think that his t-wave inversion could possible be ischemic , although the appropriate course of action be not to pursue further anticoagulation or evaluation for catheterization , give the patient 's other medical issue . he be maintain on coumadin , aspirin , zocor , questran , and lopressor . b. rhythm : the patient continue to be in atrial fibrillation throughout his hospitalization and be rate control with lopressor 37.5 mg t.i.d .

however be not consistent with the patient 's usual cardiac pain . during her stay , the patient be maintain on an aspirin , beta-blocker and a statin , although the chest pain be go on arrival to the ed . throughout the three month of the patient 's stay , she do experience similar burning , substernal chest pain . ekg and enzymes sent during these episode be always negative for ischemia . it be felt that this pain be likely secondary to gerd , a it often respond to maalox , benzo , lidocaine and/or food . 2. pump : the patient 's primary symptom of shortness of breath likely due to fluid overload . the patient be diuresed with iv lasix on the medicine floor . however , on 10/22/06 , the patient experience somnolence , low respiratory rate and desaturations in the setting of opioid

felt to be due to chf/volume overload lead to poor cardiac output , decrease perfusion to the kidney . a the patient be diuresed , her renal function improve . this be stable throughout her stay until 10/24/06 when her creatinine begin to rise . it be felt that this be due to a combination over diuresis lead to a prerenal state . no medication change have be make near that time except for lasix p.o . to iv . in the setting of creatinine bump , lasix and spironolactone be discontinue on 10/12/06 . on 10/25/06 , lasix 20 iv daily be restart because of an improve creatinine , but again hold when creatinine return a 1.5. on transfer , the patient not on lasix secondary to creatinine bumps/arf . we do not hydrate but monitor creatinine and continue diuresis when able . likely prerenal secondary

below , she may have actually continue to urinate even more so on the last day of her admission . her blood pressure be stable throughout her stay , in the low 100 , consistently below 150 systolic and above 100 systolic . rhythm : in term of her rhythm , she be find at several point throughout her stay in the first several day to have bradycardia consistent with junctional rhythm and because of her atrial fibrillation treat with amiodarone ; it be think she would benefit from a pacemaker also because of her beta-blocker . so , a pacemaker be place on 6/21/2003 without complication . the pacemaker be a dual-chamber ppm . her inr before it be place be 1.7 , and there be some ooze from the site , however , her hematocrit be stable and her hemodynamics be stable for 24 hour after the procedure . electrophysiologists analyze the device and find that it be work properly . she be schedule for follow up with dr. gutirrez on 4/13/2003 at 9:40 in the morning . she have be advise to limit her drive until that appointment . she have also be advise that she will not be able to have an mri in the future . she will be discharge on keflex ( cephalexin ) 250 mg p.o . 4 time a day for 3 day on discharge for her pacemaker and if she have any problem at all with her pacemaker she should call dr. richel at telephone # ( 851 ) 491-7503 , adetc # 33243 . 2. pulmonary : the patient have pfts do in 9/18 which show an fvc of 73 % of predict , fev1 of 77 % of predict , and fev1 to fvc ratio of 108 % , and fef 25/75 of 80 % , a tlc of 50 % of predict , an svc of 73 % of predict , a residual volume of 40 % of predict , and an rv/tlc of 72 % of predicted . her dlco uncorrected be 44 % ; her dlco correct be 44 % . during her stay , patient have low o2 saturation at rest range from the high 80 to the low 90 , but often below 88 % and on exertion consistently in the mid-80 % range , not depend on where the probe be place . she be unable to be wean from the oxygen and will be send home on oxygen . she should be follow up with a ct of the chest . a ct of the chest be do on this admission , however , it be consistent with chf and other thing could not be rule out . of note , on the chest ct there be find to be liver lesion which will be comment on below . the patient should also be work up for her pulmonary issue . 3. radiology : the patient have this chest ct which show multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacity in the lung , diffuse haziness , some septal thickening with slight basil predominance , multiple borderline mediastinal node in the anterior mediastinum , an ap window region with the large node on image 21 measure 1.3 x 2 cm , there be extensive vascular calcification , cardiomegaly with multi-chamber enlargement and particularly dense coronary calcification , trace right and leave pleural effusion . visualized organ of the upper abdomen demonstrate multiple ill-defined low attenuation focus in the liver but no other abnormality . review of bone window show extensive thoracic degenerative change , sternal wire and epicardial pacer lead . the lung finding be consistent with cardiomegaly and chf , but could not rule out other diagnostic possibility include atypical pneumonia , hypersensitivity , pulmonary hemorrhage or less likely lymphangitic tumor . in order to workup the liver mass , an ultrasound of the abdomen be attain . the liver show a mass 2.9 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm , it be hyperechoic in the posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver correspond to the dominant mass see in the ct of 7/21/203 and 11 , gallbladder be normal with no stone , the biliary tree be normal , a be the right kidney and leave kidney , pancreas , although it be poorly visualize . the spleen be normal , the aorta be normal , pleural effusion be note on the left which be small and prominent hepatic vein be note . the radiologist 's impression be that the ectogenic mass on the right low lobe of the kidney correspond in the location of the mass report on prior ct , may be a hemangioma or other ectogenic mass which could not be exclude and he note that the patient could not hold her breath sufficiently well to evaluate the mass with doppler . if indicate , the pmd should either get a nuclear scan , ct , the radiologist suggest mri but that be now impossible give the pacemaker , for confirmation and further evaluation . also , it be note that she have prominent hepatic vein possibly due to the right heart failure . other issue : 4. endocrine : the patient be continue on her levoxyl 25 and her home dose of insulin with good blood sugar control generally below fingerstick of 200 . 5. heme : the patient be continue on her niferex . her hematocrit be stable throughout her stay with her admission hematocrit be 41.8 and discharge hematocrit be 38.8. her white count also be not elevate . she be discharge with a white count of 6.8. her inr on admission be 3.2 , her coumadin be hold and 1 mg of vitamin k be give before her procedure . her inr on the day of the procedure , 6/21/2003 , be 1.7 and on discharge it be 1.3. she will be reinstituted on her same coumadin level , to follow up with dr. garder and to have her coumadin level check on 5/25/2003 and be follow a she be . discharge medication : a admission medicine except # 1 , she will be take cephalexin for 3 day and that be the only difference . her primary care doctor can consider can titrate her chf medicine and/or her hypertension medicine . escription document : 9-7893755 lm cc : stanley malek bh dictate by : macentee , ernie attending : lown ,

refuse catheterization in the past , it be decide that she be manage medically . she be start on metoprolol 12.5 mg b.i.d . as well a aspirin . the patient have remain symptom free . problem # 4 , hypertension : the patient be initially slightly hypotensive at a systolic blood pressure of 90 to 100 on hospital day # 1. her enalapril and outpatient dose of atenolol be hold . she be start back on metoprolol after the non q-wave myocardial infarction . currently , her blood pressure be maintain between 130-150 systolic . we attempt to add back enalapril at this time to preserve her kidney function give her diabetes . however , her creatinine increase mildly , thus we have elect to hold enalapril again . problem # 5 , gastrointestinal : the patient have a history of chronic constipation on home regimen of dulcolax , senna , colace and lactulose . a kub be obtain on admission which show air in the colon but no obstruction . it be think that her chronic distention be from diabetic gastroparesis and relative immobility . the patient develop diarrhea during her hospital course for which her laxative be hold . her stool have be c. difficile negative . she have tolerate very little food due to abdominal distention . she have continue to advance her diet currently to some small snack during the day . her laxative be re-instituted . because the patient continue to spike a low grade temperature and she have some abnormal liver function test , we pursue a renal ultrasound to rule out her renal abscess which be negative , as well a a right upper quadrant ultrasound . the right upper quadrant ultrasound show a possible liver mass for which we order a followup ct of the abdomen . the ct of the abdomen show normal variant of the shape of the liver , cause by a bowel loop that be anterior to the liver . this be unchanged compare to a study that she have in 1996. problem # 6 , anemia : on admission the patient be slightly anemic with a hematocrit of 30. during her past hospitalization , the patient always have a hematocrit around 30. on this admission her stool be trace guaiac positive . she receive two unit of packed red blood cell transfusion with an appropriate response to a hematocrit of 36. gi be consult . however , since the patient be stable with no further decrease in the hematocrit , it be decide that the patient would pursue an outpatient workup of her anemia in term of colonoscopy . problem # 7 , vascular : the patient have a history of peripheral vascular disease on admission . the vascular surgery service be consult to help manage refractory cellulitis . abis be obtain of the right leg which show 0.5 to 0.6 on the right low extremity and normal on the left low extremity which have be previously bypass . pulse volume record reveal mildly decreased signal in both the right and leave leg . the conclusion be that the patient have right femoral popliteal disease with normal rest pressure on the left . however , a the patient be not very mobile , she do not complain of any claudication symptom . it be decide that no surgery be indicate for her at this time . we use heparin subcutaneous injection a her dvt prophylaxis during her hospitalization . problem # 8 , congestive heart failure : the patient have congestive heart failure from diastolic dysfunction . on examination , she have 1+ edema throughout her body include her upper limb in the chest area . however , attempt at diuresis be abort due to acute renal failure . she continue to diurese on her own without any pharmacologic intervention , a her creatinine improve . at this time her lasix be hold because of a small bump in creatinine from likely the contrast in ct as well a in the enalapril . overall , she be total body volume up , however , much improve from admission . problem # 9 , type ii diabetes mellitus : the patient 's blood sugar be poorly control during the hospitalization with finger stick in the high 100 to low 200s . this be partially due to the patient 's reluctance to take her full dose of nph insulin because she be inconsistent with eating . she also have a slide scale to cover her . we will encourage her to continue with her full dose of insulin a she tolerate food well . problem # 10 , peripheral neuropathy and low back pain : the patient 's neurontin dose be reduce to 100 mg t.i.d . from her outpatient dose of 300 mg t.i.d . due to renal insufficiency . she also receive diazepam currently at 2.5 mg b.i.d . , reduce from her outpatient dose of 5.5 mg b.i.d . because of renal insufficiency . she also require morphine sulfate on a p.r.n . basis . her pain control be satisfactory at the time of this dictation . dictate by : wilber buckbee , m.d . yn2 attend : harris berdecia , m.d . tc97 tr830/8430 batch : 4532 index no .

t-wave inversion . chest x-ray : show mild vascular congestion . there be no evidence of any effusion . impression : this be a 59-year-old female with a rheumatic heart disease , status post st. jude 's mvr and avr , congestive heart failure who present with mild volume overload and abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting . brief hospital course by system : 1. cardiovascular : a. ischemia : when the patient be admit , she be rule out for an mi . she do have a slight increase of her troponins , which be attribute to mild demand ischemia . in addition , she have some slight anemia , which could also be contribute to the demand as well in addition to the clear volume overload . she do fine from the standpoint , have no st change on any of her ekg . the patient lay her head workup for future avr and mvr with the surgical service , with dr. bio . her workup be extensive and include a cardiac catheterization , which show no significant coronary artery disease . the hemodynamics be notable for the following : ra of 12 , pa of 92/23/44 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 with v wave to 42. the mitral valve be grossly normal with appropriate leaflet motion . the av be also grossly . the overall conclusion be elevate right-sided heart pressure . she have no evidence of major atherosclerotic disease of the coronary artery . b. pump : please see cath report a above . the patient be admit and diuresed with iv lasix , so she come down to a euvolemic state . her diuresis be continue with 80 mg iv lasix on a b.i.d . basis . she be diuresed until there be a subsequent bump in her creatinine to 1.8 , 1.9. after that point , diuresis be slowly modify . she be then place back on a regimen of 120 mg of p.o . lasix q.o.d . that be the dosing of lasix on which she be discharge . c.

become progressively more confused and lethargic . at baseline , she be alert and oriented and walk intermittently with walker , although , at most time she be bedbound because of her obesity and an injured knee at the end of october . over the previous week apparently , the patient have difficulty with her home oxygen machine and she felt like she `` be not get any air '' . apparently , her son have call the company that supply the oxygen . they have come in and say that he should figure out how to fix it accord to him , a she have not be get oxygen for the week prior to admission . she have

admission , the patient have increase shortness of breath , fatigue , and somnolence and apparently hallucination . the emergency medical service be call and she be unarousable at home and they find her oxygen sat to be 40 % . by the time she in to the er she be lethargic and moan incoherently . her vitals at that time be temperature of 97.6 fahrenheit , blood pressure of 178/46 mmhg , heart rate of 106 and regular , breathe 36 time a minute and satting 90 % on 100 % nonrebreather . her fingerstick at that time be 220. her trachea be intubate and she be give fentanyl , valium , albuterol , and atrovent neb and solu-medrol in the emergency room . past medical history : significant for hypertension , severe leave ventricular hypertrophy , asthma/copd without know pulmonary function test in the past , morbid obesity weigh approximately 460 pound , obstructive sleep apnea - she could not tolerate cpap in the past , osteoarthritis , and type 2 diabetes mellitus as well a a distant history of pulmonary embolus . after have a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in 4/3 , she be anticoagulated for several month , but not since then . allergy : no known drug

1.2 and her ptt be 26.3. her urine and serum tox screen do not reveal any toxin . her chest radiograph be a poor quality film give the girth . the film be rotate . the et tube be 3.5 cm from the corner , otherwise , extraordinarily limited , but no gross consolidation or effusion be note . a pulmonary embolus ct scan or v/q scan be consider to rule out a pulmonary embolus ; however , the patient 's abdominal girth prevent either of these study from be do . low extremity noninvasive study be perform , which do not show any clot although this be also limit by her chronic low extremity change . urine culture and blood culture be send on 10/28/06 . the urine culture grow mixed flora and the blood culture have be negative to date . assessment at the time of admission : this be a 54-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen as well a obstructive sleep apnea , hypertension , and leave ventricular hypertrophy and obesity with mental status change and respiratory change consistent with an exacerbation of recurrent obstructive pulmonary disease and hypoxemia . hospital course by system : 1. pulmonary : her trachea be extubated within several hour of come to the medical intensive care unit . at first , she be do quite well on bipap at 25 and 5 ; however , she become a bit more somnolent and the decision be make to intubate her trachea once again within several hour . an abg at that time be do , which reveal an arterial blood gas at that time with an fio2 of 60 % reveal a ph of 7.19 , a co2 of 119 , and an oxygen of 106 with saturation of 97 % . a we be prepare to intubate the trachea , the patient become more alert and request to speak to her son beforehand and say she do not want to have the tube down her throat . her son come in and she continue make more sense and ask u not to intubate her trachea . the decision be make to observe her with the bipap , which be do . within several hour her carbon dioxide have decrease to 103 and then by 3 hour after that it actually decrease to 80. her arterial blood gas at that time show ph of 7.32 with a pco2 of 80 , a po2 of 71 on 2l of actual nasal cannula and then o2 saturation of 95 % . she remain on bipap intermittently at various set . her final setting be pressure support of 20 and a peep of 5. her co2 range from the mid 60 to 99 without a very clear correlation between her mental status and her co2 . the thought be that her baseline co2 be probably somewhere in the 70 give that her ph be normal with pco2 around in the low 80 . it be think that she be a chronic carbon dioxide retainer . her bicarbonate on admission here previously have be in the mid to high 30 and low 40 just a they be during this admission and that she just have an acute hypercarbic event . throughout her stay she have have episode where she become slightly less responsive always will awake with appropriate physical stimulus and will give appropriate response . she be treat for her pulmonary disease initially with corticosteroid , which be discontinue give that we do not feel that she have large a inflammatory component to this , levofloxacin 500 mg a day , albuterol and atrovent nebulizer and she be start on an inhaled corticosteroid . 2. vascular : the possibility of a pulmonary embolus be consider especially give her history of pulmonary embolus in the past . unfortunately , diagnostic imaging be inadequate give her girth and low extremity issue . there be discussion of put her on chronic anticoagulation for the possibility of pulmonary embolus ; however , we felt she have a low to moderate probability of pulmonary embolus and that the risk of long-term anticoagulation outweigh the benefit give that she probably do not have a pulmonary embolus or deep venous thrombosis . this be discuss with the patient and she agree with that decision . this can be readdressed in the future . the decision be also center around the fact that her previous pulmonary embolus be in the setting of pelvic surgery and likely do not reflex any increased likelihood of thrombosis . however , she should be continue on subcutaneous enoxaparin or other prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis while she be bedbound . 3. cardiac : the patient have a history of hypertension and leave ventricular hypertrophy . she should be continue on enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg a day , lisinopril 40 mg a day , and she will discharge on atenolol 25 mg per day . 4. endocrine : the patient have type 2 diabetes mellitus . she be manage in the hospital on a low dose of insulin nph and aspart slide scale . on discharge , she will be resume on her home dose of sulfonylurea . it may be consider that she will be good candidate for metformin give her weight and likely poor control of her diabetes . 5. obstructive sleep apnea with know elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure at approximately 90+ right atrium and echocardiogram during her last admission at mertaymonpeters medical center . the patient should be counsel and encourage to use her bipap or cpap machine at home all the time at night give her likely severe obstructive sleep apnea and know vascular effect of that . medication on discharge : 1. lisinopril 40 mg by mouth each day . 2. atenolol 25 mg by mouth each day . 3. enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg by mouth each day . 4. enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous each day . 5. albuterol and atrovent nebulizer every 4 hour and p.r.n . wheezing or shortness of breath , this may be change to inhaler when the patient can tolerate and she should be educate on that . 6. flovent . 7. levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth each day for 5 more day . 8. flagyl 500 mg by mouth twice a day for 11 more day for treatment of trichomonas . 9. glyburide 5 mg by mouth once daily . 10. regular insulin slide scale a determine by the doctor at rehabilitation with meal . 11. bipap 20 for pressure support and 5 of peep every night all , night and during the day a require . it would be recommend that she be on bipap continuously for at least 48 hour after discharge a tolerate by the patient except to speak with her family . escription document : 4-2420264 emssten tel dictate by :

creatine kinase be elevate on admission to 574. it be rechecked on april , 2004 , and it be 1967. it be felt that this be due to two factor . increase release from the muscle , a the patient 's mb-fraction be only 33.5 , which be less than 5 % and the troponin be negative . so this be felt to be due to her increased work of breathing and release from the muscle and exacerbate by her acute renal failure and retention of the creatine kinase . her creatine kinase decrease by july , 2004 , to 1195. therefore , it be not felt that the patient have rhabdomyolysis cause renal failure , but rather renal failure cause retention of creatine kinase disease from increase work of breathe . 5. hematology : the patient be continue on her coumadin . the patient 's inr throughout her stay remain therapeutic between 2.4 and 2.6. on may , 2004 , it be 2.5. she be continue on her home dose . the patient 's white blood cell count be elevate at admission at the outside hospital with a left shift . she be start on levofloxacin and steroid . therefore , it be difficult to interpret her white count deferential . her white count remain elevate between 15 and 20 throughout her stay . her neutrophil count remain between 70 and 78 % of that . a urinalysis be send , which do not suggest that the patient have a urinary tract infection . 6. the patient 's tsh be 0.46 with a normal t4 of 7.8. she will

admission , in addition , her urinalysis show many red blood cell . it do have some white blood cell and leucocyte esterase . this be most likely just because the patient have bleeding , secondary to her foley catheter . discharge medication : please use the patient 's discharge sheet for discharge medication . escription document : 1-0714061 emssten tel dictate by : barus , bernard attend : wulff

female with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus complicate by bka on two prior occasion , who be admit to the micu with a bka in the setting of urosepsis and a non-q-wave mi . hospital course : her hospital course by system be a follow : 1. endocrine : a note above , the patient present with bka in the setting of urosepsis and a non-q-wave mi . she be place on an insulin drip and hydrate with intravenous fluid , with improvement . she be eventually transition to nph with insulin slide scale coverage . despite escalate her dose of nph up to 65 u subcu b.i.d . on the day of discharge , she continue to have elevate blood sugar > 200 and require coverage with insulin slide scale . this issue will need to be address a an outpatient . 2. pulmonary : posthydration , the patient be note to have increase respiratory rate and o2 requirement and rale on exam . a her creatinine have improve concurrent with hydration , she be gently diuresed . an echocardiogram be obtain to assess her left ventricular function in the context of her non-q-wave mi , which be notable for normal leave ventricular function , with an ef of 50 % , hypokinesis of the inferior septum , a right ventricle that be mildly enlarge , with mildly decrease systolic function , normal aortic valve , mild tr , and mild mr , and a pulmonary artery pressure of 39 mm of mercury plus right atrial pressure consistent with pulmonary hypertension and no pericardial effusion . with her body habitus put her at risk for dvt and pe , an echocardiogram which show evidence of pulmonary hypertension raise the concern for pe be responsible for her symptom of tachypnea and tachycardia . a spiral ct be obtain that be nondiagnostic secondary to her body habitus . a vq scan be obtain , which be read a low probability for pe . in addition , she also have negative lenis . these study take together alleviate the concern of pe or dvt in her . it be felt that the patient likely have obstructive sleep apnea secondary to her body habitus . she be maintain on cpap during her hospitalization stay ; however , the patient inform the treating team that she would not be use a cpap machine once she return home secondary to the inconvenience and discomfort . 3. id : on admission to micu , give her positive urinalysis , she be place on cefotaxime for gram negative coverage . both her blood culture and urine culture grow out e. coli which be sensitive to cefotaxime and gentamycin . a she initially continue to be febrile and continue to have positive blood culture , one dose of gentamycin be give for synergy . subsequently , she improve . she remain on iv cefotaxime for the 7-day period that she be in the micu . on transfer to the floor , she be switch to p.o . levofloxacin and will take 7 day of p.o . levofloxacin to complete a total 14-day course of antibiotic for urosepsis . 4. cardiovascular : patient rule in for a non-q-wave mi by ekg and enzyme . her peak ck be 1200 , with a troponin of 1.52. she be initially place on aspirin , heparin , and a beta blocker . once her creatinine normalize , an ace inhibitor be also add . heparin be discontinue once the concern for pe be alleviate . her beta blocker and ace inhibitor be titrate up for a goal systolic blood pressure of < 140 and a pulse of < 70 . she be transfer to the floor on hospital day 7 , where she remain stable . another guanosine mibi be obtain , a the patient report that she would be unable to exercise , give her chronic low back pain and sciatica . a planar study be do secondary to her body habitus , which reveal a moderate sized area of prior myocardial infarction throughout the mid lad coronary territory , with moderate residual peri-infarct ischemia . the cardiology service do not feel that the degree of this lesion warrant catheterization , give the sizable risk of catheterization in her . 5. renal : on presentation , the patient have a creatinine of 2.1 , up from her baseline of 1.4. she be felt to have acute renal failure , secondary dehydration , in the setting of diabetic ketoacidosis . she be rehydrated and concurrent with this her creatinine return to her baseline and remain stable thereafter .

be euvolemic . rhythm : a note above , the patient admit with status post vf arrest . he be successfully defibrillate out of that with shock x 1. however , his course be complicate by an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate up to the 160s associate with hypotension for which he be electively cardioverted with shock x 1 to normal sinus rhythm after which he be load with a 10-g amio load , and he have remain in normal sinus rhythm since that episode . however , after the patient have be transfer to the floor and be stable , he receive a single lead aicd give his history of dilate cardiomyopathy , coronary artery disease , and status post vf arrest . pulmonary : the patient be initially intubate in the ccu for airway protection . he be rapidly wean on the sedation .

stair , at clinic and this also show frequent pvc . he have an electrocardiogram that show an ejection fraction of 30 % . past medical history : 1. he have a coronary artery bypass graft in 1974 and 1982. he have pci of his left main coronary artery 6/18 and ptca and brachytherapy secondary to in-stent restenosis in april , 2002. intervention 6/18 his left main be radiate . his bypass vessel be lima/lad , svg/marginal 1 , lima/lad , svg/rpda . 2. he have a significant gi bleed secondary to aspirin and plavix in 2002. his hematocrit go to 17. the patient have remain on aspirin and plavix secondary to his coronary artery disease . 3. history of prostate cancer treat with radiation , complicate by radiation prostatitis . 4. diabetes . 5. status post right carotid endarterectomy . no history of tia or stroke . allergy : no known drug allergy . medication on admission : aspirin 81 mg ; plavix 75 mg ; atenolol 25 mg once a day ; isordil 60 mg twice a day ; lisinopril 20 mg once a day ; norvasc 5 mg once a day ; lipitor 10 mg once a day ; gemfibrozil 600 mg twice a day ; hydroxyzine 25 mg twice a day ; glyburide 10 mg twice a day ; metformin 1 , 000 mg twice a day ; nexium 40 mg once a day ; iron sulfate 300 mg once a day ; calcium 1250 twice a day ; multivitamin once a day ; vitamin e ; folic acid ; colace . family history : he have several sibling with coronary artery disease in their 60 . social history : he be a former engineer for ssand lare , but stop work when he be in his 40 because of his coronary artery disease . he deny any tobacco , alcohol , or drug use . he live with his wife . review of system : two-pillow orthopnea that be stable , no palpitation . physical examination : vital sign : temperature 95.1 , heart rate 58 , blood pressure 112/50 , breathe 22 , satting 98 % on room air . heent : extraocular movement intact . pupil equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation . jvp be 10.0 cm with a right carotid endarterectomy scar . cardiovascular : normal s1s2 . lung : clear to auscultation bilaterally . abdomen : soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sound . extremity : no low extremity edema . neuro : cranial nerve ii-xii intact . laboratory data : on admission . sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , chloride 104 , bicarb 23 , bun 35 , creatinine 1.5 his baseline be 1.4 , glucose 148 , white count 9.0 , hematocrit 37 , platelet 297. liver function test be within normal limit . ck 125 , mb 1.6 , troponin 0.02. electrocardiogram show right bundle branch block and 2-3 beat of normal sinus rhythm intersperse with nsvt . hospital course : 1 ) cardiovascular : ischemia : it be unclear whether the patient 's worsen chest pain be from progression of his coronary artery disease or whether this be demand ischemia from his frequent nsvt . he be rule out for a myocardial infarction by enzyme but give the persistence of his arrhythmia , he be take for catheterization . his catheterization show an lad 100 % lesion , diag 1 80 % lesion , leave circumflex 100 % lesion , the ramus be widely patent , rca show a 100 % lesion , right pda 100 % lesion . overall , his lima graft to the lad be widely patent , his svg graft to marginal 1 and svg graft to rca be both occlude but have collateral . what be new from his previous catheterization be disease in his pda . it be determine to far treat the patient 's coronary artery disease with medical management . after his heart rate be control with amiodarone and with a pacemaker , he do however continue to have some fatigue and shortness of breath . a a result he have an adenosine mibi to evaluate for functional ischemia give the finding on his catheterization . the mibi show a moderate size perfusion defect throughout the inferior and basal inferoseptal and inferolateral wall show a moderate amount of reversibility . his ejection fraction be estimate at 50 % with akinesis of the inferior and inferoseptal wall with reduced thickening . he do not have any ekg change during the procedure . his beta blockade be increase to lopressor 50 b.i.d . and he continue on his nitrate . he be actually able to tolerate ambulation without feel any pain or shortness of breath . it be possible that the symptom that he have later on in the hospitalization be secondary to volume overload which respond well to diuresis . he will follow up with dr. rafi . it be unlikely that any intervention will be able to be do but he will explore this a an outpatient . 2 ) pump : the patient do experience some shortness of breath several day into his admission . he have be approximately four liter positive over several day . he be give 20 mg of iv lasix and respond well . he be send home with 20 mg of lasix q. monday and thursday . 3 ) rhythm : the patient 's electrocardiogram and telemetry strip be concern because while he be technically in normal sinus rhythm , he be usually only in normal sinus rhythm for 3-4 beat at a time at most , and in between that , have several run of nsvt . the nsvt never progress to sustain v-tac and the patient be always hemodynamically stable . however , there be concern that this could ultimately progress to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation . he be load on amiodarone 400 mg p.o . t.i.d . which he tolerate well . he also require an additional 150 mg iv x 1 load to stabilize his rhythm . he have an icd and ddi pacemaker place on 7/26 without complication . after the pacemaker be place he be still experience some fatigue and it be think that he may have be overpaced . a a result his setting be adjust to increase his av delay 240 and he be change to ddd mode . he also have a number of beat shorten that would be require to detect the vt , to 24. by the time of discharge his amiodarone be decrease to 400 mg q.d . this may ultimately be decrease even far to 200 but will be decide by dr. swymer . 4 ) endocrinology : the patient have a history of diabetes . we hold his metformin on admission because of his catheterization but restart it upon discharge . any elevated blood sugar be cover with an insulin slide scale . 5 ) pulmonary : a mention above the patient do have some shortness of breath which be likely due to volume overload . he respond well to 20 mg iv lasix . he always maintain his oxygen saturation . he will have pulmonary function test a an outpatient to establish a baseline give his new treatment with amiodarone . 6 ) heme : the patient do have a history of a gi bleed on aspirin and plavix . we monitor his hematocrit closely . he come in at 37. it do decrease to 31. during his hospitalization he have an episode of bright red blood per rectum . give his history of radiation proctitis and proctatitis it be not surprising that he have this . he always remain hemodynamically stable and do not require any transfusion . at baseline his hematocrit be probably closer to 33 and it be likely that the 37 be an elevation from decrease p.o . intake . follow up stool be guaiac-negative . followup : he will follow up a an outpatient with dr. halvorson and fabus on 4/4/03 . he will also have pulmonary function test on 5/8 . discharge medication : amiodarone

534,"924727476 | cg | 42816438 | | 7011259 | 8/6/2006 12:00:00 be | right chronic leg ulcer | sign | dis | admission date : 3/6/2006 report status : sign discharge date : 1/16/2006 date of admission : 3/6/2006 attending : derocher , shaun antonio md addendum : admission to the icu : 2/8/06 . this will be the hospital course and plan as well a the discharge medication . hospital course : 1. low extremity wound : the patient have several left low extremity wound which by report have be chronic as well a a deep acute onset right low extremity wound which be ulcerate to the level of muscle . it be think that this wound have occur a a result of a hematoma after incision and drainage by surgical service one to two week prior to admission . there be no obvious evidence of infection , however , it be certainly possible that there be a soft tissue surround that ulcer . there be some thought of whether that could be osteomyelitis underlie the ulcer . the patient have tibial and fibula film which at first there be some consideration of whether there be abnormality to the bone . on further consideration , it be felt this be most likely not the case , however , to evaluate more specifically a bone scan be perform . there be no uptake in the area of that ulcer , however , there be some mild uptake at the left achilles tendon calcaneal insertion and mark uptake in the t9 thoracic 9th vertebra . a cat scan of the spine be perform which reveal no evidence of infection or neoplasm but there be evidence of osteopenia and possibly a microfracture but no evidence of real compression fracture . the patient be see and examine by the vascular surgery consult service and dr. smallidge , her primary vascular surgeon . their recommendation in term of wound dressing be three time a day , wet-to-dry dressing change with 4 x 8 gauze sponge . it be recommend that the patient follow up with dr. goolden in mid 9/6 . please call dr. usman 's office for an appointment . the recommendation for three time a day wet-to-dry dressing without additional ointment or treatment . the patient should be follow by wound care service . in addition , the patient have small necrotic region on her heel . these should be treat with panafil . in term of her sacral decubitus ulcer , the patient be see by the plastic surgery service , they debrided the wound twice , there be minimal amount of superficial necrotic tissue which be excise . their recommendation for further care be to apply one-quarter strength dakin 's solution soak wet-to-dry dressing to be change twice a day for 48 hour that will be for 36 hour from discharge and then this treatment should be change to standard wet-to-dry dressing twice daily to that sacral decubitus ulcer . they recommend that she be place on an air mattress . she should have turn at least every 2 hour . they also recommend that her weight be keep off the sacrum and that her nutrition be optimize . she be place on a multivitamin , continue on calcium , start on zinc , vitamin c supplement a well . the patient should follow up with dr. roscoe szymonik a an outpatient . this should be schedule by call 390-948-8630 . 2. infectious disease : the patient be initially admit with a low-grade temperature . it be unclear whether she have a primary infection and what the source of that infection be . culture be take from blood , urine , and sputum . all blood culture be negative . urine culture grow extended spectrum beta-lactamase resistant klebsiella pneumonia which be intermediate to ciprofloxacin and sensitive to levofloxacin . because the patient have so little urine output it be unclear whether at first this be a colonizer or an actual infection . infectious disease consultation be request . their recommendation be to start ciprofloxacin and then this be change to levofloxacin when the final susceptibility come back and they continue that for a two-week course . she be currently on levofloxacin 500 mg iv q.48h . this course will finish on 9/4/06 . sputum culture grow multidrug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa as well a a few acinetobacter which be also resistant to many antibiotic . after close consultation with infectious disease consultation service it be decide that these be most likely colonizer . there be no evidence of an acute pneumonia or tracheobronchitis and the patient be not treat for her colonization with acinetobacter and pseudomonas . in the past she have have multiple other multiple drug resistant organism that grow from her sputum culture at other institution and it be felt that unless she demonstrate evidence of clinical pulmonary infection these should not be treat . overall , her hemodynamic status be stable and she be afebrile throughout her course . several day into her admission , however , she do have one episode of low blood pressure initially treat with intravenous fluid and then norepinephrine infusion for short period of time . however , on repeat cuff pressure manually it be reveal that her blood pressure actually be normal and that there be dysfunction possibly because of her obesity of the automatic cuff , therefore it be think that this low blood pressure be spurious and probably an artifact of the cuff that be be use . so in conclusion the only medication on discharge will be levofloxacin 500 mg q.48h . through 9/4/06 . 3. cardiovascular : the patient have a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation . she be on toprol 12.5 mg by mouth two time a day throughout her stay . her heart rate range from 120s-130s when she be first admit to 50s-60s on discharge . this should be readdressed regularly in term of her need for rate control . at this point , she will be discharge on that low dose of beta-blocker . otherwise , she be admit on coumadin with a inr of 2-3 for her st. jude 's aortic valve . her inr be therapeutic on admission . this be actually discontinue after a couple of day in anticipation of a possible procedure . it be restart three day prior to discharge . she be on heparin a a bridge for anticoagulation in the meantime . she should be continue on the heparin with a goal ptt of 50-70 until her inr be therapeutic at 2-3 and this should be rechecked to make sure that her inr remain therapeutic . her care be discuss with her primary cardiologist , dr. sean mesa . 4. endocrine : the patient have a history of type 2 diabetes . her diabetes be control with insulin nph 35 unit subcutaneous every morning with a regular insulin slide scale every 6 hour as well . this should be continue and fingersticks should be do every 6 hour . the patient also have a history of hypothyroidism . her thyroid stimulating hormone level be check and be find to be elevate at 14.5. her thyroid replacement dose be increase from 75 mcg per day to 88 mcg a day . her thyroid stimulating hormone level should be check again in four to six week and dose adjustment accordingly . 5. pulmonary : the patient be continue on her mechanical ventilation . there be attempt at low pressure support and even spontaneously breathe trial . she be not able to tolerate these for a long period of time , however , it do seem that she have improve to some degree in term of her ventilatory mechanic . she be currently on pressure support ventilation at 15 of pressure support and 5 of positive end expiratory pressure with an fio2 of 0.4. we believe that she could probably be wean slowly to significantly decreased pressure support and i believe most likely she will be able at some point to be take off the ventilator , although this be certainly not certain . she will be continue on her nebulizer treatment . 6. nutrition : the patient be continue on tube feed . she be on full strength nepro at 50 cc per hour . in addition , she be get vitamin c supplementation , ascorbic acid 500 mg by mouth two time a day , nephrocaps , zinc sulfate 220 mg by mouth daily and these should be continue a indicated for her renal failure and wound healing . 7. psychiatric : the patient be continue on her home dose of fluoxetine 20 mg by g tube daily and on zyprexa 10 mg by g tube at bedtime . 8. prophylaxis : throughout her stay , the patient be continue on her home esomeprazole 40 mg by g tube twice a day and for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis , her inr on coumadin remain above 1.4 and her ptt be keep therapeutic on intravenous heparin . intravenous heparin should be continue with ptt check on admission and then every 6 hour unit they be fairly stable between 50 and 70 and that should be monitor at least daily until her inr be stably therapeutic . it will be very important to monitor her inr carefully while she be on levofloxacin as well . 9. access : the patient have a left-sided midline which be place in mid 8/6 . this should be remove within the next one week and another line place a prefer by the rehabilitation physician . in addition , the patient 's dialysis catheter while functional do seem to have erode through the skin below her clavicle . the hemodialysis service should be aware and consider replacement a indicated . at this point there be no indication of infection of either of those line , however , she be at high risk of infection of both . 10. renal : the patient be continue on her hemodialysis a per the renal service . please feel free to contact dr. napoleon r lafevre , the patient 's icu physician here at ciledall hospital with any question you may have . a note in the dictation , the patient should follow up within the next three to four week with dr. mcniel of vascular surgery and also with the plastic surgery service . medication on discharge : 1. vitamin c 500 mg by g tube two time a day . 2. peridex mouthwash 15 ml twice a day . 3. fluoxetine

then have swelling of her hand and arm as well a a rash . mri in 2/17 show no change or evidence of tumor recurrence . the patient , while on the general medical service , have an extensive rheumatologic , neurologic , and hematologic workup , at which point she undergo both bone marrow biopsy and unsuccessful lp under iv conscious sedation . the patient become unresponsive and hypothermic about 2 hour after her bone marrow biopsy and be therefore transfer to the micu on 10/6/05 for close observation . she seem encephalopathic during this stay and be start empirically on ampicillin , cefoxitin , and acyclovir . she be then send for a ct-guided lumbar puncture require intubation . she be extubated on 4/18/05 . she be then transfer out to the floor where she continue to improve . hospital course in more detail by system below . hospital course : 1. the patient have a history of obstructive sleep apnea and use cpap at home . her outpatient pulmonologist at the ceanmin chbre memorial be contact who confirm this . on admission , she have a normal o2 saturation with a relatively clear chest x-ray . however , she become hypothermic and unresponsive follow her bone marrow biopsy . she also require intubation for ct-guided lumbar puncture for airway protection in the setting of her excessive sedation . she be extubated on 4/18/05 and her oxygen be quickly wean off . since then she have be oxygenate and ventilate well on room air . cpap be continue at night . she have have no other pulmonary complication . 2. cv . the patient have no history of cardiac disease . an echocardiogram do on 6/1/05 show normal lv function with preserved ejection fraction , no wall motion abnormality , moderate tricuspid regurgitation , and mild mitral regurgitation . in term of her rhythm , the patient have a rest bradycardia in the 30 to 40 that be think to be secondary to increase vagal tone and have no hemodynamic consequence . she receive atropine while in the icu at 1 mg x 1 on two separate occasion ; in the first instance for bradycardia to a heart rate of 19 in the setting of get vasoconstrictor for a low blood pressure and the second time when she have a heart rate down to 30. after the patient be transfer out to the floor , we do obtain a dedicated ep service cardiology consult , who evaluate the patient . they confirm that her bradycardia be most likely due to vagal tone . she respond appropriately with an increase in her heart rate with exertion . in this young woman , it be deem that a pacemaker would not be an appropriate choice . she do have 3-4 second pause on one occasion on the floor but have no recurrence throughout the rest of her stay . if after discharge she develop further pause or a syncopal episode , this issue can be revisit . while she be in house , we do keep atropine and zoll pad at the bedside but do not have to use it once she be transfer out of the icu . in term of ischemia , the patient have a slightly elevate ck-mb on admission , but she have have a normal echocardiogram and negative troponin since . 3. renal . the patient develop acute renal failure during the early part of her stay think secondary to acyclovir , which have be give for presumptive meningitis . her abdominal ultrasound be negative and urine eosinophil be also negative . her creatinine improve with appropriate hydration and be normal at the time of discharge ( creatinine equal to 1.0 ) . 4. the patient do have a history of hypernatremia . initially , her home ddavp be hold for fear that it would be difficult to diurese her if she become volume overload give her somewhat elevated creatinine . however , her sodium continue to increase to 155 despite get free water repletion , so her ddavp be restart on 10/5/05 . she be discharge on her home dose of ddavp of 0.2 mg p.o . q.a.m . and 0.4 mg p.o . q.p.m . with one nasal spray q.h.s . her sodium at the time of discharge be 145. she have be follow by the endocrine service in house for this . they have recommend that she not increase her home dose , instead she will aggressively increase her p.o . water intake in order to maintain her normal sodium . she will follow up in two week with dr. kearley of endocrine who will recheck her electrolyte at that time . 5. derm/rheumatology . the patient be evaluate by both of these service during her stay . she have biopsy do of several location that show nonspecific pathology consistent with mixed connective tissue disease . however , her serology have , for the most part , be negative . she be treat presumptively with stress-dose and eventually pulse steroid . these be tapered towards her stay . she will be discharge on a quick taper of hydrocortisone 20 mg p.o . b.i.d . for two day , after which she will revert to her home dose of 20 mg p.o . q.a.m . and 10 mg p.o . q.p.m . 6. endocrine . the patient have panhypopituitarism and be follow by the endocrine service throughout her stay . in term of her thyroid function , the patient be continue on her home dose of levoxyl . it be difficult to interpret her tsh in the setting of panhypopituitarism ; therefore we follow her t4 , t3 , and free t4 level . these be rechecked towards the end of her stay once she have recover from her acute illness and in light of a slightly decrease free t4 level , her levoxyl be increase to 275 mcg p.o . daily at the time of discharge . 7. diabetes insipidus . the patient 's hypernatremia be correct with d5 water and increase her p.o . fluid intake . she be also put back on her home dose of ddavp . 8. growth hormone . there be no indication for growth hormone replacement . 9. adrenal insufficiency . the patient complete a course of stress dose steroid for her procedure and then get pulse steroid per wound for a question of lupus versus mixed connective tissue disorder . however , this be taper over her stay and she will be discharge on a very brief taper . she will go back to her home regimen of hydrocortisone . 10. gonadotropin . the patient be continue on aviane ( ocp ) during her stay . 11. neurologic . the patient have no clear etiology for her hypersomnolence . she be follow by the neurologic service in house . she do not appear to be hypercarbic or hypoxic . her infectious workup be entirely negative and she be therefore take off antibiotic . her eeg show nonspecific diffuse slow with no seizure focus . the default diagnosis have be that some of her symptom , include her altered mental status , low extremity edema , rash , and perhaps even pancytopenia , may be secondary to provigil . this be therefore discontinue and she should not start this once she return home . initially , her stimulant be hold for fear that they be contribute to her pancytopenia . however , her ritalin be restart once her count start to recover . she be discharge on ritalin-sr 20 mg p.o . b.i.d . her mental status seem to improve on this regimen . at the time of discharge , she be awake , alert , able to converse well , and at her baseline . 12. hematologic . the patient present with pancytopenia , again of unclear etiology . bone marrow biopsy be negative for leukemia , lymphoma , and myelodysplasia . rather , it be consistent with a viral effect or drug effect . her count have resolve by the time of discharge with a white blood count equal to 9.26 , hematocrit of 27.6 , and platelet of 266. this too may have be due to provigil effect . 13. prophylaxis . the patient be maintain on pepcid for gi prophylaxis and heparin for dvt prophylaxis . 14. code . full . 15. id . the patient have multiple blood , urine culture , and csf culture send . these be all negative . of note , stool culture be positive for c. difficile . she be therefore start on p.o . flagyl 500 mg p.o . t.i.d . on 9/20/05 . she will complete a 14-day course of this antibiotic . disposition : home with vna service . condition on discharge : satisfactory . complication during this hospital stay : none . to do/followup plan : 1. the patient should follow up with her pcp in 1-2 week . 2. the patient should follow up with dr. bodenstein in the endocrine department in 2-4 week . she can be reach at 842-444-3923 . 3. the patient should aggressively increase her oral water intake in order to keep her sodium within normal limit . 4. the patient should call her doctor if she have any change in her mental status or if she develop nausea , vomit , abdominal pain , rash , shortness of breath , lightheadedness , or any other worrisome symptom . 5. of note , the patient 's biopsy suture on her left abdomen and right forearm be remove on the day of discharge . these area appear to have heal well . her central line be also remove on 3/9/05 without complication . discharge medication : 1. pepcid 20 mg p.o . b.i.d . 2. hydrocortisone 20 mg p.o . b.i.d . x 4 dos start in the a.m. of 9/10/05 . 3. hydrocortisone 20 mg p.o . q.a.m . and 10 mg p.o . q.p.m . start on 1/12/05 ( p.m. dose to be give at 4

be admit to the general surgery service on the direction of dr. morgan taverner on 1/1/2005 . a mentioned previously , her admission be schedule several day prior to a plan surgery in order to permit adequate evaluation by the pulmonary , thoracic surgery and rheumatology service in order to clear for her planned surgical intervention give her history of polychondritis . follow extensive review by the above-named service , the patient be clear for operative intervention and subsequently undergo an open cholecystectomy on 6/25/2005 . for detailed description of the patient 's operative procedure , please see the relevant operative report . the patient tolerate the procedure well and be subsequently transfer to the surgical intensive care unit for further evaluation and management postoperatively . give concern about her airway and for continuous monitor give concern about her body habitus . while in the intensive care unit , the patient could rest well clinically without acute event . she remain stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and her pulmonary status be note to be stable through the duration of her initial admission to the intensive care unit . follow closed observation in the icu , the patient be subsequently clear for transfer to the regular patient floor on postoperative day number one , 4/1/2005 . while on the regular floor , the patient initially progress well clinically . she be successfully wean from iv analgesia and be transition to oral pain medication without complication . she initially remain stable from a cardiovascular perspective and be note to demonstrate a stable wound exam with decline liver function study through postoperative day # 2 , 2005. at this point , once the patient be deem stable for discharge to home , she demonstrate an acute episode of increased work of breathe and shortness of breath with an abrupt increase in her oxygen requirement . despite aggressive attempt to improve oxygenation through noninvasive mean , the patient prove to unable to achieve oxygenation status with these measure and be transfer emergently to the intensive care unit for intubation . of note , arterial blood gas drawn in the context of this episode demonstrate a widened a-a gradient concern for a possible coronary embolus . give the patient 's habitus and her weight , however , she be deem inappropriate for a pe protocol scanning and be treat presumptively for pulmonary embolus . the remainder of the patient 's admission be spend in the intensive care unit and be punctuate by respiratory failure , suspect pulmonary embolus require ongoing heparin therapy , development of intraabdominal bile leak require repeat exploratory laparotomy and drainage procedure . the subject of the patient 's admission will be further describe by system a follow : 1. neurological : for the duration of her extended stay in the intensive care unit , the patient remain adequately sedate with iv agent include fentanyl and verse . of note , the patient be note to demonstrate massive requirement of sedate analgesic agent in order to provide adequate comfort . despite this , however , she be successfully wean to a regimen of intermittent opioid dosing via her g-tube , which she be note to tolerate without complication . with gradual withdrawal of her sedating agent , the patient be note to be appropriate and responsive and demonstrate no evidence of neurological compromise . of note , the patient at no demonstrated any evidence of acute neurological event or cerebrovascular accident necessitate further evaluation from a neurological perspective . at the time of this dictation , the patient be note to be alert , orient and comfortable on an analgesia regimen consist of stable fentanyl infusion and p.r.n . oxycodone . she be note to move all extremity to command , note to be appropriate to question , demonstrate no evidence of neurological compromise on gross exam . 2. cardiovascular : the patient 's intensive care unit stay be punctuate by progressive septic physiology require ongoing pressor support for a period of several week in order to maintain adequate profusion pressure . a her intraabdominal process progress , the patient be note to require increase support with multiple agent include neosynephrine and vasopressin ; however , follow appropriate surgical debridement of her intraabdominal bile collection , she be gradually successfully wean from pressor agent and at no point afterwards require far aggressive pressure therapy in order to maintain adequate pressure . she at no point demonstrate any evidence of acute myocardial ischemia despite multiple rule out protocol in the setting of hypertensive episode . serial bedside echocardiograms demonstrate no evidence of acute myocardial dysfunction or diminution of ejection fraction and she subsequently be note to stabilize from cardiovascular perspective . of note , over the course of her admission , the patient be note to demonstrate periodic episode of idiopathic bradycardia unrelated to oxygenation status ; however , she at no point require external pacing or atropine therapy in order to treat such episode and be note on all occasion a spontaneously resolve her bradycardic episode . at the time of this dictation , the patient be note to be stable with regular rate and rhythm and no evidence of acute myocardial dysfunction . she be free of pressor support and continue on a stand regimen of lopressor 25 mg per j-tube q.6h . without complication . followup ekg demonstrate no evidence of myocardial ischemia and she have be free of episode of bradycardia for at least the past 10 day . 3. pulmonary : a describe above , the incite event for the patient 's return to the intensive care unit on postoperative day # 2 be note to be acute respiratory distress secondary to presume pulmonary embolus . unfortunately , the patient 's body habitus preclude her from a definitive pulmonary embolus protocol ct scan and she be therefore start empirically on iv heparin therapy in order to provide adequate anticoagulation . her weight incidentally also preclude her from additional study to evaluate for evidence of pulmonary embolus include a vq scan , thus her pe treatment regimen be base on empiric evidence only . follow institution of heparin therapy , the patient 's oxygenation status be note to gradually improve , although her pulmonary status be note to decline with subsequent increase in fluid requirement give her septic physiology . serial day x-ray perform in intensive care unit demonstrate evidence of fluid overload through the course of her stay , which also likely compromise her oxygen status initially . give her ongoing requirement for pressor therapy while follow the development of her intraabdominal pathology , the patient be recommend for a tracheostomy procedure give the expectation of prolonged mechanical ventilation requirement . she therefore underwent peg placement on 3/11/2005 follow an extensive discussion with the patient 's family regard her likely prognosis . for a detailed discussion of this procedure in the context of a concomitant repeat exploratory laparotomy and j-tube/g-tube insertion , please see relevant operative report . follow placement of this tracheostomy , the patient progress well clinically from respiratory perspective . follow drainage of her intraabdominal bile leak , the patient 's septic physiology be note to gradually resolve and she be successfully wean from pressor therapy . with cessation of her pressor , adequate diuresis be render possible and the patient be effectively fluid oscillate for the duration of her intensive care unit stay . with the fluid oscillating , the patient 's respiratory status continue to improve a such her serial chest x-ray demonstrate gradually resolve over load . with diuresis , the patient be subsequently gradually wean from pressor support to successful trach collar trial , which she accomplish without complication . a the time of this dictation , the patient be note to be tolerate to the extended trach collar trial during the day with planned ventilatory arrest at night . her respiratory exam demonstrate lung be clear to auscultation bilaterally with mild bibasilar crackle and no additional evidence of acute respiratory failure . her trach site be clean , dry , and intact with no evidence of cuff leak . the patient be successfully tolerating trial of a passe muir valve , which have provide her with ability to vocalize while on her trach collar trial . a potential plan for trach tube downsizing have be defer for the movement give concern about the risk of return the patient to the operating room for this procedure . give the lack of acute indication for such a procedure , it have be deem best to defer such an intervention until such surgery deem absolutely necessary . 4. gi : shortly , follow the patient 's readmission to the intensive care unit , she be note to demonstrate gradually increase liver function study suggestive for potential repeat biliary obstruction . the gi service be , therefore , enlist to come and tell me potential appropriateness of an ercp . follow extensive discussion with the gastroenterology service , the patient be subsequently recommend for an ercp to be perform in the operating room , which subsequently take place on 3/11/2005 . this selection of the operating room a the site for intervention be inform on the basis of her inability to be effectively scoped in the radiology suite give her body habitus . in the operating room , the patient underwent successful placement of a biliary stent with liberation of a mild amount of bilious fluid from the common bile duct . no sphincterotomy be perform at this point . follow placement of the stent and successful prominence of the ercp , the patient be initially note to improve clinically with a transient diminish in her biliary study . however , shortly follow , she again note gradual increase in her biliary study and gradual worsening in her general clinical exam associate with increase fever and septic physiology . serial abdominal exam be notable for gradual increase abdominal distension , necessitate a return to the operating room on 3/11/2005 for a combined tracheotomy , exploratory laparotomy , drain placement , g-tube/j-tube placement , and biliary drainage procedure . for a detailed description of the patient 's operative procedure , please see a relevant operative report . of note , the patient be note to demonstrate a 3-liter bile collection intraoperatively with no evidence of bowel injury or ischemia upon perform of this procedure . multiple intraabdominal drain be place and no evidence of active bile leak be note at the time of this procedure . postoperatively , the patient progress well clinically . her biliary function study be note to gradually normalize follow the drainage procedure and her abdominal exam remain stable for the duration of her posterior course . follow effective drainage of this collection , the patient 's septic physiology be note to gradually correct , allow effective weaning of her pressor support and mark in all organ system function . she thereafter successfully start no tube feed for nutritional supplementation , which she tolerate without complication . at all time , effective gi prophylaxis be provide by pepcid and ppi therapy . at the time of this dictation , the patient 's gi exam remain stable . her abdomen be soft , nondistended and nontender with evidence of morbid obesity per her baseline exam . her surgical incision be note to be clean , dry and intact with staple in place . of note , her midline incision be leave partially open in order to promote adequate wean drainage postoperatively and to permit heal by secondary intervention ; this incision have continue to remain stable with no evidence of active infection postoperatively . her drain output have gradually diminish over her postoperative course , permit removal of one of her jp drain . her g-tube and j-tube site remain clean , dry and intact with her tube remain in place and functional . the patient be currently run tube feed at goal via her j-tube without complication . her g-tube continuous to vent appropriately without incident . 5. gu : following transfer , the patient to the intensive care unit her urinary output continue to be monitor on a continuous basis in order to reassess her hydration status . through the course of her time of septic physiology , the patient demonstrate variable urine output correlate approximately with her blood pressure . with resolution of her septic physiology , however , the patient be note to be exuberantly responsive to effort at diuresis and be quickly note to be independently productive of large amount of urine without diuretic therapy . she successfully oscillate her fluid through the duration of her admission , at no point demonstrate any evidence of acute renal failure or electrolyte abnormality . she at no point demonstrate any evidence of a hemodialysis requirement during the course of her admission . at the time of this dictation , the patient remain independently productive of adequate amount of urine in order of 700 cc per hour via her foley catheter . her electrolyte remain stable and bun and creatinine demonstrate no evidence of acute renal failure . 6. heme : a state previously , the presumed etiology of the patient 's return to the intensive care unit be think to be an acute , hemodynamically stable pulmonary embolism . the patient be immediately start on heparin therapy , which continue for the duration of her icu stay until the point of transition to coumadin therapy . of note , the patient require large dos of heparin in order to provide a therapeutic ptt with hourly infusion rate in order of 2000-2500 unit of heparin per hour . follow prolonged heparin invasion and gradual stabilization of her clinical status , the patient be gradually transition to coumadin therapy via her j-tube without complication . at the time of this dictation , the patient remain borderline therapeutic on coumadin with an inr of 1.7 on a daily dose of coumadin 5 mg per day . she at no point have demonstrate any evidence of postoperative hemorrhage or bleeding instability ; her platelet count have likewise remain stable for the duration of her stay . although , the potential for placement of an ivc filter be discuss on several occasion during the duration of her current admission , the patient 's body habitus preclude her from effective radiological placement of such a filter and such intervention be therefore be defer at least for the time be . 7. id : follow transfer of the patient to the intensive care unit , she be note to demonstrate gradually worsen septic physiology associate with spike fever for much of her initial intensive care unit stay . serial culture of blood , sputum , urine and biliary drainage be notable for evidence of near pan-resistant pseudomonas in her biliary drainage site . an infectious disease consultation be therefore obtain . the patient be recommend for broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy consisting of linezolid , ceftazidime , flagyl and colistin . with gradual worsening of her clinical condition , the patient be subsequently start on a course of xigris for a 96-hour period per xigris protocol . while on xigris , the patient do not demonstrate any appreciable improvement in her septic status and she be therefore recommended for operative intervention on 3/11/2005 a describe above . follow drainage of her abdominal bile collection , the patient be note to gradual improve clinically with slow resolution of her septic state . followup culture continue to demonstrate evidence of biliary pseudomonas colonization necessitate ongoing colistin therapy . with further speciation of her culture , the patient be subsequently wean from all antibiotic except for colistin and underwent placement of a picc line for plan prolonged colistin therapy . with stabilization of her clinical status , the patient be subsequently restart on her home dapsone regimen in order to promote pcp prophylaxis give her home immunosuppressive and steroid regimen . at the time of this discharge , the patient remain afebrile with stable white blood cell count and no additional culture information suggest for ongoing infection . she have a stable and appropriately position upper extremity picc line , which be functional and continue to permit adequate dosage of her stand colistin antibiotic regimen . a of this dictation , the patient be plan for ongoing colistin therapy for several week pending modification by the infectious disease service . 8. endocrine : in the context of her icu readmission , the patient be note to demonstrate widely fluctuant blood sugar require continue therapy with a portland protocol insulin schedule . follow successful resolution of her septic physiology , however , the patient be successfully wean from insulin therapy without complication and be note to demonstrate stable blood sugar for the duration of her stay . give her home steroid requirement for her chronic polychondritis , the patient be place on a steroid taper for the duration of her intensive care unit stay , which she continue at the time of this dictation . at no point do she demonstrate any evidence of acute adrenal insufficiency or thyroid dysfunction in the course of her admission . at the time of his dictation , the patient remain under evaluation for plan transfer to a vented rehabilitation facility . the remainder of the patient 's hospital course and her discharge medication regimen will be dictate at the time of her transfer by an appropriate member of the intensive care unit team . escription document : 4-9850357 em dictate by : jochems , solomon attending :

electrocardiogram on admission show normal sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement and leave bundle branch block . her electrocardiogram in clinic show a wide complex tachycardia and a left bundle branch block . her chest x-ray show no pulmonary edema or infiltrate . hospital course : this patient be a 72-year-old woman with a significant ischemic heart disease who be admit with wide complex tachycardia . 1 ) cardiovascular - ischemia : the patient 's abnormal rhythm be presume to be ventricular tachycardia give her history of severe ischemic heart disease . once her tachycardia be stabilize she be take to catheterization which show patent graft . she do have a small increase in her troponin but this be think to be relate to demand . she do not have any complaint of chest pain during the hospitalization . we continue her on her beta blocker and initially hold her digoxin while we be control her rhythm . she be slightly hypotensive during her episode of tachycardia so we initially hold her accupril as well , but her medication be resume a few day before discharge . pump : at the time of admission the patient be classify a have class ii heart failure although she do admit to not be very active and it be felt that if the patient exert herself more she would have more symptom . on her catheterization her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure be find to be 31 with a normal right atrial pressure . she also have a repeat echocardiogram which show an ejection fraction of 15 % with 1+ mr and a thick aortic and mitral valve . she do not exhibit any sign of volume overload during her hospitalization and we continue her home dose of lasix . we also keep her on a two liter fluid restriction but her creatinine soon begin to increase from a baseline level of 1.4 to a peak of 2.1. the patient do admit that she drink a significantly large amount of fluid at home and so she be quite hypovolemic in comparison to what she be normally use to . a a result we liberalize her fluid restriction and her creatinine normalize . rhythm : when the patient arrive her tachycardia resolve and she be in normal sinus rhythm . however , later that even she go back into ventricular tachycardia . she have stay in ventricular tachycardia with her heart rate often reach the 130s for several minute at a time . her blood pressure be always stable in the 90s/50s . she deny any chest pain . she be give an amiodarone load of 150 mg iv x 1 over 20 minute and also start on a p.o . load of 400 mg p.o . t.i.d . over the next two day she continue to have episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia for five minute at a time and ultimately her ventricular tachycardia progress so that she would have episode of 10-15 minute at a time . when she become symptomatic she be start on an amiodarone drip . this be do through a peripheral line and after several hour the patient develop a mild phlebitis . she be take off the drip and place again on p.o . amiodarone . her vtac be think to be primarily due to her ischemic cardiomyopathy and we discuss the need for an icd with her . she be reluctant but ultimately agree . we do also discuss the possibility of an ep study and ablation but the patient prefer the least invasive method possible . while the patient be currently in compensate heart failure , a mention previously it be felt that this be because she do not exert herself any further , and that it be likely that she would within the next year or two , decompensate and have more symptom of congestive heart failure . because of the severity of her disease a dual-chamber pacemaker be also place at the same time a the icd . the patient tolerate the procedure well . by the time of discharge her amiodarone be decrease to 200 b.i.d . this will likely be decrease to 200 q.d . a an outpatient . she do not have any more episode of vtac . 2 ) endocrinology : we keep the patient on her same insulin regimen of 60 unit in the morning and in the evening and cover her with an insulin slide scale . 3 ) pulmonary : the patient will have pulmonary function test a an outpatient give her therapy with amiodarone . at baseline she do not have any pulmonary complaint . 4 ) id : when the patient be give iv amiodarone she do develop phlebitis . despite the fact that the amiodarone be quickly discontinue , she do develop what appear to be a mild cellulitis . she be start on keflex and her cellulitis resolve . during the hospitalization she also have a urinary tract infection with e. coli . we be limit in the antibiotic that we could choose . we do not want to use levofloxacin because of the potential to prolong her qt give that she be take amiodarone and elavil . she have an allergy to bactrim which have a report history of renal failure . we be not able to find out any more detail on this reaction . a a result we give her a seven-day course of cefpodoxime give that the uti be speciate to e. coli . 5 ) rheumatology : the patient have a history of gout . we continue her allopurinol . disposition : the patient be send home with her daughter . we do offer for her to have vna but she refuse and felt that her need would be meet at her daughter 's house . at the time of discharge she be not sure whether she be go to move back to her home eventually in the ba or whether she be go to sell her home and move close to family . followup : the patient have follow up appointment with dr. stuber and dr. buhr she will have pulmonary function test . discharge medication : pravachol 10 mg p.o . once a day ; elavil 20 mg p.o.q.d . ; nph 60 mg q. a.m. and q.

oxygen and be currently saturate 97 % on room air . the plan be for her to continue on aspirin , plavix , high-dose lipitor , and beta-blocker , and nitrate a need . 2. in term of her acute renal failure , base on the record from the trickvan agi health network , her creatinine have jump from 1.1 to 2.5 in three day . this be felt to be most likely due to intrinsic renal failure . she do not have a low urine output and she have receive amikacin in the past few day prior to admission as well a contrast dye and she do have a history of contrast dye induce nephropathy lead to a predialysis state , although she do not get dialysis on that occasion . here , we simply avoid nephrotoxic agent , be judicious in the use of lasix with strict ? ? ____ ? ? control , and her creatinine gradually begin to decrease and today it be down to 1.6. infectious disease wise , she come with the documented urinary tract infection report to be due to e. coli resistant to levofloxacin and gentamicin . here , we culture her again and find e. coli more than a 100 , 000 colony , which be resistant to ampicillin , gentamicin , ciprofloxacin , and levofloxacin . it be sensitive to ceftazidime and she therefore receive renally dose ceftazidime for her uti to complete a 7 to 10-day course . blood culture draw on the 24 of april show no growth to date . the patient have also be afebrile in with a white blood cell count between 7 and 11 , 000. in term of her hypertension , of note , it have be difficult to measure her blood pressure , probably measure her blood pressure in her left arm by palpation be a most reliable way to do this . she be treat here with hydralazine , lopressor , and diuretic . on discharge , she feel well . today , she tell me that she have not fill this for a long time . she have no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath . she be afebrile with a temperature of 98. her pulse range between 60 and 70. her blood pressure be between 102 and 150 systolic and she be satting 95 % on room air . her current weight be 73 kg and she be deem to be euvolemic so this should be her target weight and she be ambulate with assistance . she be alert and oriented x3 in no acute distress . she have get pupil equal , round , and reactive to light . she have only a few bibasilar crackle on base . otherwise , her lung be clear . her heart have a regular rate and rhythm with no gallop , rub , or murmur . her abdomen be benign . her extremity be warm . her right calf be quite tender to palpation . she have a document old dvt in her gastrocnemius vein . this be old and she have probably get some postphlebitic syndrome and should be follow . she be neurologically grossly intact . her laboratory at discharge include the following : sodium 139 , potassium 4.7 , her creatinine be 1.6 , bun be 50 , her white blood cell count be 11.01 , hematocrit 28.5 , hemoglobin 9.2 , and platelet 258 with an inr of 1.2. her medication at discharge include the following : 1.

be diuresed with lasix a need to achieve a dry weight goal of 72 kg . she should continue on ceftazidime for her urinary tract infection until august and her calf pain - dvt should be follow , one possibly to raise the clevewill ent hospital a this may represent in a cold malignancy , for which she may need to be work up once the acute setting be over . study perform at this hospital include the following : a renal ultrasound a part of her workup for acute renal failure reveal a right kidney with a size of 11.8 cm and apical cortical cyst , leave kidney 10.6 cm , and no hydronephrosis . the patient also have a mibi , spect of her heart , which reveal the following : the combine ? ? ____ ? ? ischemia plus scar during the stress be moderately abnormal with a summed stress score of 9.

. the angiography team advise that the hematocrit drop could be a result of blood loss from recent angio intervention . the angio team advise that there will be no need to pursue image to search for source of blood loss unless the patient have further hematocrit drop or unless she develop leg , abdominal and back pain symptom . because of the patient 's history of coronary disease , she be order for a 2units a blood . she only receive one unit of blood because she be symptomatic with hypertension and chest pain when the second bag be hung ( see cardiovascular pump section above ) .

the setting of hypertensive urgency with documented blood pressure of 194/74 . her symptom resolve with blood pressure control . the medical team suspect that : 1. the cause of the patient 's episodic lightheadedness prompt multiple visit to the d.sen health may be from atrial fibrillation with rvr and/or ventricular pause . additional workup for this can be pursue by dr. gehrer a an outpatient . 2. give the significant history of vascular disease and the finding on recent mra , the team suspect that the patient may have hypertension-induced gut ischemia and microvascular cardiac angina . this be preliminary discharge summary and the discharge addendum include discharge medication , final diagnosis and medical followup will need to be dictate at the time of discharge . escription document :

of lisinopril 40 q.d . from a pump standpoint we felt that perhaps her mitral regurgitation be the main cause of her 2-3 month history of increase dyspnea on exertion , exercise intolerance , and increase orthopnea . thus , we get a repeat echo which show borderline leave ventricular hypertrophy with an estimate ejection fraction of 55 % , normal rv . the mitral valve be moderately thickened
